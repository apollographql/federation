## Who is Apollo?

[Apollo](https://apollographql.com/) builds open-source software and a graph platform to unify GraphQL across your apps and services. We help you ship faster with:

* [Apollo Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/studio/develop/) – A free, end-to-end platform for managing your GraphQL lifecycle. Track your GraphQL schemas in a hosted registry to create a source of truth for everything in your graph. Studio provides an IDE (Apollo Explorer) so you can explore data, collaborate on queries, observe usage, and safely make schema changes.
* [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/apollo-federation) – The industry-standard open architecture for building a distributed graph. Use Apollo’s open-source gateway to compose a unified graph from multiple subgraphs, determine a query plan, and route requests across your services.
* [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/apollo-client/) – The most popular GraphQL client for the web. Apollo also builds and maintains [Apollo iOS](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios) and [Apollo Android](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android).
* [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) – A production-ready JavaScript GraphQL server that connects to any microservice, API, or database. Compatible with all popular JavaScript frameworks and deployable in serverless environments.
