# Apollo Federation

Apollo Federation is an architecture for declaratively composing APIs into a unified graph. Each team can own their slice of the graph independently, empowering them to deliver autonomously and incrementally.

Federation 2 is an evolution of the original Apollo Federation with an improved shared ownership model, enhanced type merging, and cleaner syntax for a smoother developer experience. It’s backwards compatible, requiring no major changes to your subgraphs.

Checkout the [Federation 2 docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation) and [demo repo](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-fed2) to take it for a spin and [let us know what you think](https://community.apollographql.com/t/announcing-apollo-federation-2/1821)!

For Federation 1, see the [docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/v1) and [code](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/tree/version-0.x).

## Who is Apollo?

[Apollo](https://apollographql.com/) builds open-source tools and commercial services to make application development easier, better, and accessible to more people. We help you ship faster with:

* [GraphOS](https://www.apollographql.com/graphos) - The platform for building, managing, and scaling a supergraph: a unified network of your organization's microservices and their data sources—all composed into a single distributed API.
* [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/federation) – The industry-standard open architecture for building a distributed graph. Use Apollo’s gateway to compose a unified graph from multiple subgraphs, determine a query plan, and route requests across your services.
* [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) – The most popular GraphQL client for the web. Apollo also builds and maintains [Apollo iOS](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios) and [Apollo Kotlin](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin).
* [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) – A production-ready JavaScript GraphQL server that connects to any microservice, API, or database. Compatible with all popular JavaScript frameworks and deployable in serverless environments.
