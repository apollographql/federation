# [2.0.2] - 2022-05-03

## ‚ùó IMPORTANT NOTES ‚ùó

- The `fetch` implementation used by default by `UplinkFetcher` and `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` is now imported from `make-fetch-happen` v10 instead of v8. We don't believe this should cause any compatibility issues but please file an issue if this created any unintentional problems.
- `v2.0.0` accidentally added a limit of 15 simultaneous requests per subgraph; that has been removed. Please accept this new release as our penance.
- We no longer export a `getDefaultFetcher` function. If you were using this function, you can replace `const fetcher = getDefaultFetcher()` with `import fetcher from 'make-fetch-happen'`.
