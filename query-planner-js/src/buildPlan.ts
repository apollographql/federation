 * to make some conservative assumption regarding concrete runtime behaviour. In particular,
 * it assumes that:
 *  - all fields have the same cost (all resolvers take the same time).
 *  - that field cost is relative small compare to actually doing a subgraph fetch. That is,
 *    it assumes that the networking and other query processing costs are much higher than

   * plans a query has, since it compute all those options to compare them. Further, the number of possible
   * plans double for every field for which there is a choice, so miminizing the number of field for which we
   * have choices is paramount.
   *
   * And for a given type, __typename can always be provided by any subgraph having that type (it works as a
   * kind of "always @shareable" field), so it often creates theoretical choices. In practice it doesn't
   * matter which subgraph we use for __typename: we're happy to use whichever subgraph we're using for
   * the "other" fields queried for the type. But the default query planning algorithm does not know how
   * to do that.
   *
   * Let's note that this isn't an issue in most cases, because the query planning algorithm knows not to
   * consider "obviously" inefficient paths. Typically, querying the __typename of an entity is generally
   * ok because when looking at a path, the query planning algorithm always favor getting a field "locally"
   * if it can (which it always can for __typename) and ignore alternative that would jump subgraphs.
   *
   * But this can still be a performance issue when a __typename is queried after a @shareable field: in
   * that case, the algorithm would consider getting the __typename from each version of the @shareable
   * field and this would add to the options to consider. But as, again, __typename can always be fetched
   * from any subgraph, it's more efficient to ignore those options and simply get __typename from whichever
   * subgraph we get any other of the other field requested (on the type on which we request __typename).
   *
   * It is unclear how to do this cleanly with the current planning algorithm however, so this method
   * implements an alternative: to avoid the query planning spending time of exploring options for
   * __typename, we "remove" the __typename selections from the operation. But of course, we still
   * need to ensure that __typename is effectively queried, so as we do that removal, we also "tag"
   * one of the "sibling" selection (using `addAttachement`) to remember that __typename needs to
   * be added back eventually. The core query planning algorithm will ignore that tag, and because
   * __typename has been otherwise removed, we'll save any related work. But as we build the final
   * query plan, we'll check back for those "tags" (see `getAttachement` in `computeGroupsForTree`),
   * and when we fine one, we'll add back the request to __typename. As this only happen after the
   * query planning algorithm has computed all choices, we achieve our goal of not considering useless
   * choices due to __typename. Do note that if __typename is the "only" selection of some selection
   * set, then we leave it untouched, and let the query planning algorithm treat it as any other
   * field. We have no other choice in that case, and that's actually what we want.
