/**
 * A `DeferNode` corresponds to one or more @defer at the same level of "nestedness" in the planned query.

 * the query that is _not_ deferred (so the part of the query up until we reach the @defer(s) this handle),
 * while each "deferred block" correspond to the deferred part of one of the @defer handle by the node.
 *
 * Note that `DeferNode` are only generated if defer support is enabled for the query planner. Also note that
 * if said support is enabled, then `DeferNode` are always generated if the query has a @defer, even if in some
 * case the generated plan may not "truly" defer the underlying fetches (in cases where `defered[*].node`
 * are all undefined; this currently happens because some specific case of defer cannot be handled, but could
 * later also happen if we implement more advanced server-side heuristic to decide if deferring is judicious or
 * not). This allow the executor of the plan to consistely send a defer-abiding multipart response to the client.
