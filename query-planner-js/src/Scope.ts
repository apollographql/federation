/**
 * A chain of type conditions leading to a particular point within an object.
 *
 * For instance, for a query like:
 * ```
 * {
 *   v {
 *     f1
 *     ... on X {
 *       f2
 *       ... on Y @myDirective {
 *         f3
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * and assuming the type of field `v` is `V`, then the scope for `f1` would be just type `V`,
 * while the one for `f2` is the chain `X <- V` and the one for `f3` is the chain `Y <- X <- V`.
 *
 * Mainly, the scope contains enough information to 1) to compute the set of possible runtime
 * type an object can have at a given point in the query (@see `possibleRuntimeTypes`) and
 * 2) recreate minimal type conditions to obtain that set of possible runtimes.
 *
 * Additionally, the scope keep track of any directive that is applied on one of the type
 * condition it represents. So in the example below, the scope will aslo track that for
 * reaching `f3` there is a `@myDirective` directive on the `Y` condition.
 *
 * Do note that scope attempts to be "minimal" in that they eschew unecessary conditions. For
 * example, in query:
 * ```
 * {
 *   v {
 *     ... on X {
 *       ... on V {
 *         f
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * still assuming that `v` is of type `V` and assuming that X is a subtype of V, the scope for field
 * `f` will simply be `V <- X` (instead of `V <- X <- V`) as the outermost `... on V` condition adds
 * nothing (but scope always preserve the most inner type condition as for a field, this is the type
 * in which the field is defined). Additionally, if type `X` happens to a _super type_ of `V`, the
 * scope for `f` would simply be `V`.
