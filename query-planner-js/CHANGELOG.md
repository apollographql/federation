# CHANGELOG for `@apollo/query-planner`

## vNEXT

> The changes noted within this `vNEXT` section have not been released yet.  New PRs and commits which introduce changes should include an entry in this `vNEXT` section as part of their development.  When a release is being prepared, a new header will be (manually) created below and the appropriate changes within that release will be moved into the new section.

- _Nothing yet. Stay tuned._

## v0.6.3

- Updates to transitive dependencies.  No other substantial changes.

## v0.6.0

- `FetchNode`s may now contain a property `inclusionConditions` which informs the executor whether or not a `FetchNode` can be skipped entirely at runtime. Inclusion conditions may consist of literals and variables, so must be resolved at execution time rather than during query planning. This change to the query plan format is backwards compatible - query plan executors may ignore this property altogether and the results will be the same. Utilizing this property is simply an optimization to allow an executor to skip sending subgraph requests which will evaluate to no data. [PR #1113](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1113)

## v0.5.2

- Updates to transitive dependencies.  No other substantial changes.

## v0.5.1

- Adjustments to internal TypeScript types [PR #1030](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1030)

## v0.5.0

- __BREAKING__: This is a breaking change due to a `peerDependencies` update (`graphql@^15.4.0` -> `graphql@^15.5.3`). This `graphql` version includes a fix which is being necessarily adopted within the `@apollo/federation` package. See associated CHANGELOG entry in the `federation-js` folder for additional details. [PR #1008](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1008)

## v0.3.1

- Narrow `graphql` peer dependency to a more fitting range `^15.4.0` based on our current usage of the package. This requirement was introduced by, but not captured in, changes within the recently released `@apollo/query-planner@0.3.0`. As such, this change will be released as a `patch` since the breaking change already accidentally happened and this is a correction to that oversight. [PR #913](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/913)

# v0.3.0

-  Introduce support for removing @inaccessible elements from the API schema. [PR #807](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/859)
- Mask inaccessible typenames in runtime operation errors. [PR #893](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/893)

# v0.2.3

- Permit @tag and @inaccessible core declarations. [PR #859](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/859)

# v0.2.2

- types: Explicitly declare `FetchGroup[]` return type from `dependentGroups` in `buildQueryPlan`.

# v0.2.1

- Fix plan querying a subgraph with an interface it doesn't know due to directives. [PR #805](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/805) [Issue #801](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/issues/801)

# v0.2.0

- Expand the range of supported `node` versions in the package's `engines` specifier to include the now-tested Node.js `16`. [PR #713](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/713)

# v0.1.4

- Add missing `deep-equal` dependency, which was accidentally installed to the monorepo's root. [PR #709](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/709)

# v0.1.3

- Fix query plans missing fields in some situations involving nested type conditions (#396).
- Fix duplicate fetches in query plans [PR #671](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/671).

# v0.1.2

- This change is mostly a set of follow-up changes for PR #622. Most of these changes are internal (renaming, etc.). Some noteworthy changes worth mentioning are: the splitting of entity and value type metadata types and a conversion of GraphMap to an actual `Map` (which resulted in some additional assertions). [PR #656](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/656)

# v0.1.1

- Remove unnecessary dependency on `@apollo/query-planner-wasm`

# v0.1.0

- Initial release of TypeScript query planner code extracted from `@apollo/gateway`. (Previous releases of this package were wrappers around `@apollo/query-planner-wasm`, a different implementation.)
