# This Lerna-based monorepo is intended to be `npm install`'d from the root
# of the monorepo.  The root `package-lock.json` is the source of truth for the
# entire monorepo. While running `npm install` in individual packages might
# work in some cases, it can produce a `package-lock.json` in those directories
# that would break the Lerna monorepo experience for Lerna, other devleopers,
# and the workflows that are built into this repository's CI workflows.
