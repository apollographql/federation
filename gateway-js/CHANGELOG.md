- Updated dependencies [[`33b937b18d3c7ca6af14b904696b536399e597d1`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/33b937b18d3c7ca6af14b904696b536399e597d1), [`09cd3e55e810ee513127b7440f5b11af7540c9b0`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/09cd3e55e810ee513127b7440f5b11af7540c9b0), [`d7189a86c27891af408d3d0184db6133d3342967`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/d7189a86c27891af408d3d0184db6133d3342967), [`33506bef6d755c58400081824167711c1747ee40`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/33506bef6d755c58400081824167711c1747ee40), [`1f72f2a361a83ebaaf15ae052f5ca9a93fc18bfc`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/1f72f2a361a83ebaaf15ae052f5ca9a93fc18bfc)]:

## 2.7.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`493f5acd16ad92adf99c963659cd40dc5eac1219`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/493f5acd16ad92adf99c963659cd40dc5eac1219)]:
  - @apollo/federation-internals@2.7.1
  - @apollo/composition@2.7.1
  - @apollo/query-planner@2.7.1

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Implement progressive `@override` functionality ([#2911](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2911))

  The progressive `@override` feature brings a new argument to the `@override` directive: `label: String`. When a label is added to an `@override` application, the override becomes conditional, depending on parameters provided to the query planner (a set of which labels should be overridden). Note that this feature will be supported in router for enterprise users only.

  Out-of-the-box, the router will support a percentage-based use case for progressive `@override`. For example:

  ```graphql
  type Query {
    hello: String @override(from: "original", label: "percent(5)")
  }
  ```

  The above example will override the root `hello` field from the "original" subgraph 5% of the time.

  More complex use cases will be supported by the router via the use of coprocessors/rhai to resolve arbitrary labels to true/false values (i.e. via a feature flag service).

  - @apollo/federation-internals@2.6.1
  - @apollo/composition@2.6.1
  - @apollo/query-planner@2.6.1

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Add more information to OpenTelemetry spans. ([#2700](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2700))

  Rename `operationName` to `graphql.operation.name` and add a
  `graphql.operation.type` attribute, in conformance with the OpenTelemetry
  Semantic Conventions for GraphQL. The `operationName` attribute is now
  deprecated, but it is still emitted alongside `graphql.operation.name`.

  Add a `graphql.document` span attribute to the `gateway.request` span,
  containing the entire GraphQL source sent in the request. This feature
  is disable by default.

  When one or more GraphQL or internal errors occur, report them in the
  OpenTelemetry span in which they took place, as an exception event. This
  feature is disabled by default.

  To enable the `graphql.document` span attribute and the exception event
  reporting, add the following entries to your `ApolloGateway` instance
  configuration:

  ```ts
  const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
    // ...
    telemetry: {
      // Set to `true` to include the `graphql.document` attribute
      includeDocument: true,
      // Set to `true` to report all exception events, or set to a number
      // to report at most that number of exception events per span
      reportExceptions: true,
      // or: reportExceptions: 1
    },
  });
  ```

- Update `license` field in `package.json` to use `Elastic-2.0` SPDX identifier ([#2741](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2741))

- Introduce the new `@policy` scope for composition ([#2818](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2818))

  > Note that this directive will only be _fully_ supported by the Apollo Router as a GraphOS Enterprise feature at runtime. Also note that _composition_ of valid `@policy` directive applications will succeed, but the resulting supergraph will not be _executable_ by the Gateway or an Apollo Router which doesn't have the GraphOS Enterprise entitlement.

  Users may now compose `@policy` applications from their subgraphs into a supergraph.

  The directive is defined as follows:

  ```graphql
  scalar federation__Policy

  directive @policy(
    policies: [[federation__Policy!]!]!
  ) on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT | INTERFACE | SCALAR | ENUM
  ```

  The `Policy` scalar is effectively a `String`, similar to the `FieldSet` type.

  In order to compose your `@policy` usages, you must update your subgraph's federation spec version to v2.6 and add the `@policy` import to your existing imports like so:

  ```graphql
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.6", import: [..., "@policy"])
  ```

- Add graphql.operation.name attribute on gateway.plan span ([#2807](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2807))

  - @apollo/query-planner@2.5.7
  - @apollo/composition@2.5.7
  - @apollo/federation-internals@2.5.7

## 2.5.6

### Patch Changes

  - @apollo/composition@2.5.6
  - @apollo/federation-internals@2.5.6
  - @apollo/query-planner@2.5.6

## 2.5.5

### Patch Changes

- Fix specific case for requesting \_\_typename on interface entity type ([#2775](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2775))

  In certain cases, when resolving a \_\_typename on an interface entity (due to it actual being requested in the operation), that fetch group could previously be trimmed / treated as useless. At a glance, it appears to be a redundant step, i.e.:

  ```
  { ... on Product { __typename id }} => { ... on Product { __typename} }
  ```

  It's actually necessary to preserve this in the case that we're coming from an interface object to an (entity) interface so that we can resolve the concrete \_\_typename correctly.

- Don't preserve useless fetches which downgrade \_\_typename from a concrete type back to its interface type. ([#2778](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2778))

  In certain cases, the query planner was preserving some fetches which were "useless" that would rewrite **typename from its already-resolved concrete type back to its interface type. This could result in (at least) requested fields being "filtered" from the final result due to the interface's **typename in the data where the concrete type's \_\_typename was expected.

  Specifically, the solution was compute the path between newly created groups and their parents when we know that it's trivial (`[]`). Further along in the planning process, this allows to actually remove the known-useless group.

- Propagate type information when renaming entity fields ([#2776](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2776))

  Aliased entity fields might have been incorrectly overwritten if multiple fields/aliases shared the same name. Query planner automatically renames conflicting fields to ensure we can always generate a valid GraphQL query. The underlying issue was that this key rewriting logic was assuming the same type of an object. In case of entity queries asking for those aliased fields, we ended up always attempting to apply field renaming logic regardless, whether or not a given entity was of the correct type. This fix ensures that the query planner logic correctly accounts for the object type when applying field renaming logic.

- Updated dependencies [[`66d7e4ce`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/66d7e4ced9a6ccd170d5e228741332395a2dd553), [`a37bbbf6`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/a37bbbf6501032f16382ccb64d1dfa0dcddac789)]:
  - @apollo/query-planner@2.5.5
  - @apollo/composition@2.5.5
  - @apollo/federation-internals@2.5.5

## 2.5.4

### Patch Changes

- Adds header to change the format of exposed query plans, and allows formatting it as json. ([#2724](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2724))

  When the gateway is configured to allow it, adding the `Apollo-Query-Plan-Experimental` header to a request already allowed a "prettified" text version of the query plan used for the query is returned in the response extension. This changes adds support for a new (optional) accompanying header, `Apollo-Query-Plan-Experimental-Format`, which can be set to the value "internal" to have the query plan returned as a json object (that correspond to the internal representation of that query plan) instead of the text version otherwise sent. Note that if that new header is not provided, then the query plan continues to be send in the previous prettified text version.

- Fix some potentially incorrect query plans with `@requires` when some dependencies are involved. ([#2726](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2726))

  In some rare case of `@requires`, an over-eager optimisation was incorrectly considering that
  a dependency between 2 subgraph fetches was unnecessary, leading to doing 2 subgraphs queries
  in parallel when those should be done sequentially (because the 2nd query rely on results
  from the 1st one). This effectively resulted in the required fields not being provided (the
  consequence of which depends a bit on the resolver detail, but if the resolver expected
  the required fields to be populated (as they should), then this could typically result
  in a message of the form `GraphQLError: Cannot read properties of null`).

- Updated dependencies [[`203b0a44`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/203b0a444782f6d6ca2f2dbb68c6e4eb59de6d45)]:
  - @apollo/query-planner@2.5.4
  - @apollo/composition@2.5.4
  - @apollo/federation-internals@2.5.4

## 2.5.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix execution error in some cases where aliases are used and some values are `null`. ([#2716](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2716))

  The error would manifest itself as an `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` with a message of the form `Cannot read properties of null`.

- Updated dependencies [[`4b9a512b`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/4b9a512b62e02544d7854fa198942aac33b93feb), [`c6e0e76d`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/c6e0e76dbc62662c2aa6ff7f657e374047b11255), [`1add932c`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/1add932c5cd1297853fb5af9a3a6aaa71243f63a), [`6f1fddb2`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/6f1fddb25d49262b2ebf6db953371a559dd62e9c)]:
  - @apollo/composition@2.5.3
  - @apollo/federation-internals@2.5.3
  - @apollo/query-planner@2.5.3

## 2.5.2

### Patch Changes

- Remove extraneous call to `span.setStatus()` on a span which has already ended. ([#2697](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2697))

  In cases where a subgraph responded with an error, we would sometimes try to set
  the status of a span which had already ended. This resulted in a warning log to
  the console (but no effect otherwise). This warning should no longer happen.

- Fix `fallbackPollIntervalInMs` behavior. ([#2709](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2709))

  The `fallbackPollIntervalInMs` serves 2 purposes:

  - it allows users to provide an Uplink poll interval if Uplink doesn't provide one
  - it allows users to use a longer poll interval that what's prescribed by Uplink

  The second bullet is how the configuration option is documented, but not how it was previously implemented. This change corrects the behavior to respect this configuration if it's provided AND is longer than the Uplink interval.

- Updated dependencies [[`35179f08`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/35179f086ce973e9ae7bb455f7ea7d73cdc10f69)]:
  - @apollo/query-planner@2.5.2
  - @apollo/federation-internals@2.5.2
  - @apollo/composition@2.5.2

## 2.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Reapply #2639: ([#2687](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2687))

  Try reusing named fragments in subgraph fetches even if those fragment only apply partially to the subgraph. Before this change, only named fragments that were applying entirely to a subgraph were tried, leading to less reuse that expected. Concretely, this change can sometimes allow the generation of smaller subgraph fetches.

  Additionally, resolve a bug which surfaced in the fragment optimization logic which could result in invalid/incorrect optimizations / fragment reuse.

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Do not run the full suite of graphQL validations on supergraphs and their extracted subgraphs by default in production environment. ([#2657](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2657))

  Running those validations on every updates of the schema takes a non-negligible amount of time (especially on large
  schema) and mainly only serves in catching bugs early in the supergraph handling code, and in some limited cases,
  provide slightly better messages when a corrupted supergraph is received, neither of which is worth the cost in
  production environment.

  A new `validateSupergraph` option is also introduced in the gateway configuration to force this behaviour.

- Support responses from subgraphs which use the `application/graphql-response+json` content-type header. ([#2162](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2162))

  See graphql-over-http spec for more details:
  https://graphql.github.io/graphql-over-http/draft/#sec-application-graphql-response-json

- Introduce the new `@authenticated` directive for composition ([#2644](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2644))

  > Note that this directive will only be _fully_ supported by the Apollo Router as a GraphOS Enterprise feature at runtime. Also note that _composition_ of valid `@authenticated` directive applications will succeed, but the resulting supergraph will not be _executable_ by the Gateway or an Apollo Router which doesn't have the GraphOS Enterprise entitlement.

  Users may now compose `@authenticated` applications from their subgraphs into a supergraph. This addition will support a future version of Apollo Router that enables authenticated access to specific types and fields via directive applications.

  The directive is defined as follows:

  ```graphql
  directive @authenticated on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT | INTERFACE | SCALAR | ENUM
  ```

  In order to compose your `@authenticated` usages, you must update your subgraph's federation spec version to v2.5 and add the `@authenticated` import to your existing imports like so:

  ```graphql
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.5", import: [..., "@authenticated"])
  ```

- Introduce the new `@requiresScopes` directive for composition ([#2649](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2649))

  > Note that this directive will only be _fully_ supported by the Apollo Router as a GraphOS Enterprise feature at runtime. Also note that _composition_ of valid `@requiresScopes` directive applications will succeed, but the resulting supergraph will not be _executable_ by the Gateway or an Apollo Router which doesn't have the GraphOS Enterprise entitlement.

  Users may now compose `@requiresScopes` applications from their subgraphs into a supergraph. This addition will support a future version of Apollo Router that enables scoped access to specific types and fields via directive applications.

  The directive is defined as follows:

  ```graphql
  scalar federation__Scope

  directive @requiresScopes(
    scopes: [federation__Scope!]!
  ) on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT | INTERFACE | SCALAR | ENUM
  ```

  The `Scope` scalar is effectively a `String`, similar to the `FieldSet` type.

  In order to compose your `@requiresScopes` usages, you must update your subgraph's federation spec version to v2.5 and add the `@requiresScopes` import to your existing imports like so:

  ```graphql
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.5", import: [..., "@requiresScopes"])
  ```

## 2.4.10

### Patch Changes

- Revert #2639 from v2.4.9 ([#2681](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2681))

  PR #2639 attempts to resolve issues with query fragment reuse, but we've since turned up multiple issues (at least 1 of which is a regression - see #2680. For now, this reverts it until we resolve the regression for a future patch release.

- Updated dependencies [[`b6be9f96`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/b6be9f9650a69f6214d806d66b198729560da3dc)]:

## 2.4.9

### Patch Changes

- Try reusing named fragments in subgraph fetches even if those fragment only apply partially to the subgraph. Before this change, only named fragments that were applying entirely to a subgraph were tried, leading to less reuse that expected. Concretely, this change can sometimes allow the generation of smaller subgraph fetches. ([#2639](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2639))

- Updated dependencies [[`7ac83456`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/7ac834568d57a9b9e63002353543d32f6e97b4a5), [`d60349b3`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/d60349b3fa7e5ba1f64c1727d88dc6faec21a38a), [`1bb7c512`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/1bb7c5129c7b07627ea33684b538fda8a83b8da8), [`02eab3ac`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/02eab3ac4a0514bef8f9253a9e43418ba1c17843), [`fd4545c2`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/fd4545c27ef343ad14436f9541f539ef80bacafa)]:

## 2.4.7

### Patch Changes

- Re-work the code use to try to reuse query named fragments to improve performance (thus sometimes improving query ([#2604](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2604))
  planning performance), to fix a possibly raised assertion error (with a message of form like `Cannot add selection of
field X to selection set of parent type Y`), and to fix a rare issue where an interface or union field was not being
  queried for all the types it should be.
- Updated dependencies [[`2d44f346`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/2d44f346c553f489d83f1c672e1ad8715665cde2)]:

- Updated dependencies [[`c96e24c4`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/c96e24c448bde3c4acfa5332335e868c701d7621)]:
  - @apollo/composition@2.4.5
  - @apollo/federation-internals@2.4.5
  - @apollo/query-planner@2.4.5

## 2.4.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix incorrect import the `assert` function in the `DataRewrite.ts`. The incorrect method was imported (due to a bad ([#2581](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2581))
  import auto-completion) and went unnoticed, leading to potential build issue.
- Updated dependencies [[`cb7f414d`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/cb7f414dde0b89f02e5c925a8f9ef1ce9b0d9b80)]:

  - @apollo/query-planner@2.4.3
  - @apollo/federation-internals@2.4.3
  - @apollo/composition@2.4.3

## 2.4.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix potential bug when an `@interfaceObject` type has a `@requires`. When an `@interfaceObject` type has a field with a ([#2524](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2524))
  `@requires` and the query requests that field only for some specific implementations of the corresponding interface,
  then the generated query plan was sometimes invalid and could result in an invalid query to a subgraph (against a
  subgraph that rely on `@apollo/subgraph`, this lead the subgraph to produce an error message looking like `"The
_entities resolver tried to load an entity for type X, but no object or interface type of that name was found in the
schema"`).
- Updated dependencies [[`2c370508`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/2c3705087284710956390c7c3444c812db7c22e0), [`179b4602`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/179b46028b914ef743674a5c59e0f3a6edc31638)]:
  - @apollo/composition@2.4.2
  - @apollo/federation-internals@2.4.2
  - @apollo/query-planner@2.4.2

## 2.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix issues (incorrectly rejected composition and/or subgraph errors) with `@interfaceObject`. Those issues may occur ([#2494](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2494))
  either due to some use of `@requires` in an `@interfaceObject` type, or when some subgraph `S` defines a type that is an
  implementation of an interface `I` in the supergraph, and there is an `@interfaceObject` for `I` in another subgraph,
  but `S` does not itself defines `I`.

- Fix handling of aliases and variables in introspection queries. ([#2506](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2506))

- Start building packages with TS 5.x, which should have no effect on consumers ([#2480](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2480))

- Improves reuse of named fragments in subgraph fetches. When a question has named fragments, the code tries to reuse ([#2497](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2497))
  those fragment in subgraph fetches is those can apply (so when the fragment is fully queried in a single subgraph fetch).
  However, the existing was only able to reuse those fragment in a small subset of cases. This change makes it much more
  likely that _if_ a fragment can be reused, it will be.
- Updated dependencies [[`450b9578`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/450b9578ec8d66a48621f0e76fe0b4f738a78659), [`afde3158`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/afde3158ec2ee93b123a9bdb0f1a852e41fa7f27), [`eafebc3c`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/eafebc3c9af5c511990fe66b7c2900ba9a1b330f), [`01fe3f83`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/01fe3f836c08805c1c53b14c745a5117c678866d)]:
  - @apollo/query-planner@2.4.1
  - @apollo/federation-internals@2.4.1
  - @apollo/composition@2.4.1

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- This change introduces a configurable query plan cache. This option allows ([#2385](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2385))
  developers to provide their own query plan cache like so:

  ```
  new ApolloGateway({
    queryPlannerConfig: {
      cache: new MyCustomQueryPlanCache(),
    },
  });
  ```

  The current default implementation is effectively as follows:

  ```
  import { InMemoryLRUCache } from "@apollo/utils.keyvaluecache";

  const cache = new InMemoryLRUCache<string>({
    maxSize: Math.pow(2, 20) * 30,
    sizeCalculation<T>(obj: T): number {
      return Buffer.byteLength(JSON.stringify(obj), "utf8");
    },
  });
  ```

  TypeScript users should implement the `QueryPlanCache` type which is now
  exported by `@apollo/query-planner`:

  ```
  import { QueryPlanCache } from '@apollo/query-planner';

  class MyCustomQueryPlanCache implements QueryPlanCache {
    // ...
  }
  ```

- Adds debug/testing query planner options (`debug.bypassPlannerForSingleSubgraph`) to bypass the query planning ([#2441](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2441))
  process for federated supergraph having only a single subgraph. The option is disabled by default, is not recommended
  for production, and is not supported (it may be removed later). It is meant for debugging/testing purposes.

### Patch Changes

- Refactor the internal implementation of selection sets used by the query planner to decrease the code complexity and ([#2387](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2387))
  improve query plan generation performance in many cases.

- Optimises query plan generation for parts of queries that can statically be known to not cross across subgraphs ([#2449](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2449))

- Updated dependencies [[`260c357c`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/260c357c10b4cf560c66d11f85552036c2638b0b), [`7bc0f8e8`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/7bc0f8e814ea003802ed3761b5eeeb7137650b0c), [`d4426ff9`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/d4426ff9ea86273c145351f80d8d18eb56ebab38), [`a9385bdb`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/a9385bdb0d6f5e9b03f9c143bbc7f34e5b5bf166), [`1a555d98`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/1a555d98f2030814ebd5074269d035b7f298f71e), [`ade7ceb8`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/ade7ceb8093f3c6ad01362d4aec4d806bff4e4fd), [`09382e74`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/09382e74adf4648582c0bbd135fe433a9853c835), [`cab383b2`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/cab383b22d37bb6bc687b4d8cec6f5c22245f41f)]:

## 2.3.4

### Patch Changes

- Handle defaulted variables correctly during post-processing. ([#2443](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2443))

  Users who tried to use built-in conditional directives (skip/include) with _defaulted_ variables and no variable provided would encounter an error thrown by operation post-processing saying that the variables weren't provided. The defaulted values went unaccounted for, so the operation would validate but then fail an assertion while resolving the conditional.

  With this change, defaulted variable values are now collected and provided to post-processing (with defaults being overwritten by variables that are actually provided).

- Updated dependencies [[`6e2d24b5`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/6e2d24b5491914316b9930395817f0c3780f181a)]:
  - @apollo/federation-internals@2.3.4
  - @apollo/composition@2.3.4
  - @apollo/query-planner@2.3.4

## 2.3.3

### Patch Changes

- Update @apollo/utils.logger typings dependency ([#2269](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2269))

- Exposes, for each subgraph request, the path in the overall gateway operation at which that subgraph request gets inserted. This path is now available as the pathInIncomingRequest field in the arguments of RemoteGraphQLDataSource.willSendRequest and RemoteGraphQLDataSource.didReceiveResponse. ([#2384](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2384))

- Previously the `queryPlanStoreKey` was a hash of the query concatenated with an unhashed `operationName` if it was present. This resulted in variable length cache keys that could become unnecessarily long, occupying additional space in the query plan cache. ([#2310](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2310))

  This change incorporates the `operationName` _into_ the hash itself (if `operationName` is present).

- Update @apollo/utils.createhash package, which drops support for node 12 ([#2266](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2266))

- Update @apollo/utils.isnodelike package, which dropped support for node 12 ([#2268](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2268))

- Update @apollo/utils.fetcher package, which drops support for node 12 ([#2267](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2267))

- Updated dependencies [[`71a07f30`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/71a07f3006e6152bb47e258546c2af717ceb687e)]:

## 2.3.2

### Patch Changes

- Move gateway post-processing errors from `errors` into `extensions.valueCompletion` of the response ([#2380](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2380))

  [https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2335](PR #2335) introduced a breaking change that broke existing usages with respect to nullability and gateway error handling. In response to [https://github.com/apollographql/federation/issues/2374](Issue #2374), we are reverting the breaking portion of this change by continuing to swallow post processing errors as the gateway did prior to v2.3.0. Instead, those errors will now be included on the `extensions.valueCompletion` object in the response object.

  Gateway v2.3.0 and v2.3.1 are both affected by this change in behavior.

- Updated dependencies []:
  - @apollo/composition@2.3.2
  - @apollo/federation-internals@2.3.2
  - @apollo/query-planner@2.3.2

## 2.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Capture non-ftv1 error information in metrics data. This ([#2242](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2242))
  error information allows the inline trace plugin to correctly
  aggregate stats about errors (where no federated trace data
  is available) and stop reporting incomplete traces which
  are missing unavailable error information.

  This PR is a precursor to apollographql/apollo-server#7136

- Fix issue where the query planner was incorrectly not querying `__typename` in a subgraph fetch when `@interfaceObject` is involved ([#2366](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2366))

- Updated dependencies [[`7e2ca46f`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/7e2ca46f57dccae6f5037c64d8719cee72adfe88), [`eb5a8bc0`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/eb5a8bc0038ea237c3bde77bbc7a2dd616fc7387)]:

This CHANGELOG pertains only to Apollo Federation packages in the 2.x range. The Federation v0.x equivalent for this package can be found [here](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/blob/version-0.x/gateway-js/CHANGELOG.md) on the `version-0.x` branch of this repo.

## 2.3.0

- Fix unexpected composition error about `@shareable` field when `@external` is on a type in a fed1 schema (one without `@link`) [PR #2343](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2343).
- Fix issue with some `@interfaceObject` queries due to missing "input rewrites" [PR #2346](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2346).

## 2.3.0-beta.3

- Rewrites gateway response post-processing to avoid `@interfaceObject` related issues [PR 2335](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2335).
- Generates correct response error paths for errors thrown during entity fetches [PR #2304](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2304).

## 2.3.0-beta.2

- Improves generation of plans once all path options are computed [PR #2316](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2316).
- Fixes composition issues with `@interfaceObject` [PR #2318](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2318).
- Fix potential issue with nested `@defer` in non-deferrable case [PR #2312](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2312).
- Adds support for the 0.3 version of the tag spec, which adds `@tag` directive support for the `SCHEMA` location [PR #2314](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2314).
- Error on composition when a `@shareable` field runtime types don't intersect between subgraphs: a `@shareable` field
  must resolve the same way in all the subgraphs, but this is impossible if the concrete runtime types have no
  intersection at all [PR #1556](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1556).

## 2.3.0-alpha.0

- **BREAKING**: composition now rejects `@override` on interface fields. The `@override` directive was not
  meant to be supported on interfaces and was not having any impact whatsoever. If an existing subgraph does have a
  `@override` on an interface field, this will now be rejected, but the `@override` can simply and safely be removed
  since it previously was ignored.
- Adds support for `@interfaceObject` and keys on interfaces [PR #2279](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2279).
- Preserves source of union members and enum values in supergraph [PR #2288](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2288).

## 2.2.3

- Fix potential issue with nested @defer in non-deferrable case [PR #2312](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2312)

## 2.2.2

- Fix issue with path in query plan's deferred nodes [PR #2281](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2281).

## 2.2.1

- Fix federation spec always being expanded to the last version [PR #2274](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2274).

## 2.2.0

- **BREAKING**: Disable exposing full document to sub-query by default (introduced 2.1.0):
  - This change decreases memory consumption in general (which is the reason for disabling this by
    default), but users that have custom code making use of `GraphQLDataSourceProcessOptions.document`
    will now need to explicitly set `GatewayConfig.queryPlannerConfig.exposeDocumentNodeInFetchNode`.
- **BREAKING**: composition now rejects `@shareable` on interface fields. The `@shareable` directive is about
  controlling if multiple subgraphs can resolve a particular field, and as interface field are never directly resolved
  (it's their implementation that are), having `@shareable` on interface fields is not completely meaningful and
  was never meant to be supported. If an existing subgraph does have a `@shareable` on an interface field, this
  will now be rejected, but the `@shareable` can simply and safely be removed since it previously was ignored.
- Allows `@shareable` to be repeatable so it can be allowed on both a type definition and its extensions [PR #2175](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2175).
  - Note that this require the use of the new 2.2 version of the federation spec introduced in this change.
- Preserve default values of input object fields [PR #2218](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2218).
- Drop support for node12 [PR #2202](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2202)

- Optimize plan for defer where only keys are fetched [PR #2182](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2182).
- Improves error message to help with misspelled source of an `@override` [PR #2181](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2181).
- Fix validation of variable on input field not taking default into account [PR #2176](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2176).

## 2.1.3

- Fix building subgraph selections using the wrong underlying schema [PR #2155](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2155).

## 2.1.2

- Allow fields with arguments in `@requires` [PR #2120](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2120).
- Fix potential inefficient planning due to `__typename` [PR #2137](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2137).

## 2.1.1

- Fix build-time regression caused by #1970 (removal of @types/node-fetch from runtime dependencies) [PR #2116](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2116)

## 2.1.0

- The method `RemoteGraphQLDataSource.errorFromResponse` now returns a `GraphQLError` (as defined by `graphql`) rather than an `ApolloError` (as defined by `apollo-server-errors`). [PR #2028](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2028)
  - **BREAKING**: If you call `RemoteGraphQLDataSource.errorFromResponse` manually and expect its return value to be a particular subclass of `GraphQLError`, or if you expect the error received by `didEncounterError` to be a particular subclass of `GraphQLError`, then this change may affect you. We recommend checking `error.extensions.code` instead.
- The `LocalGraphQLDataSource` class no longer supports the undocumented `__resolveObject` Apollo Server feature. [PR #2007](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2007)
  - **BREAKING**: If you relied on the undocumented `__resolveObject` feature with `LocalGraphQLDataSource`, it will no longer work. If this affects you, file an issue and we can help you find a workaround.
- Fix issue when using a type condition on an inaccessible type in `@require` [#1873](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1873).
  - **BREAKING**: this fix required passing a new argument to the `executeQueryPlan` method, which is technically
    exported by the gateway. Most users of the gateway should _not_ call this method directly (which is exported mainly
    for testing purposes in the first place) and will thus be unaffected, but if you do call this method directly, you
    will have to pass the new argument when upgrading. See the method documentation for details.
- Reject directive applications within `fields` of `@key`, `@provides` and `@requires`[PR #1975](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1975).
  - **BREAKING**: previously, directive applications within a `@key`, `@provides` or `@requires` were parsed but
    not honored in any way. As this change reject such applications (at composition time), it could theoretically
    require to remove some existing (ignored) directive applications within a `@key`, `@provides` or `@requires`.
- Fix issue where fragment expansion can erase applied directives (most notably `@defer`) [PR #2093](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2093).
- Fix abnormally high memory usage when extracting subgraphs for some fed1 supergraphs (and small other memory footprint improvements) [PR #2089](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2089).

- Fix issue when type is only reachable through a @provides [PR #2083](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2083).
- Fix case where some key field necessary to a `@require` fetch were not previously fetched [PR #2075](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2075).
- Add type definitions to schema extensions [PR #2081](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2081)
- Update peer dependency `graphql` to `^16.5.0` to use `GraphQLErrorOptions` [PR #2060](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2060)
- Upgrade underlying `@apollo/utils.fetcher` to support aborting a request. This is a type-only change, and will not impact the underlying runtime. [PR #2017](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2017).
- Some TypeScript types, such as the arguments and return value of `GraphQLDataSource.process`, are defined using types from the `@apollo/server-gateway-interface` package instead of from `apollo-server-types` and `apollo-server-core`. This is intended to be fully backwards-compatible; please file an issue if this leads to TypeScript compilation issues. [PR #2044](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2044)
- Don't require `@link` when using `@composeDirective` [PR #2046](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2046)

- Fix fragment reuse in subgraph fetches [PR #1911](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1911).
- Custom `fetcher`s should now accept a `Request` object which has a `signal: AbortSignal` property https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#requestinit for request timeout purposes. [PR #2017](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2017)
- Expose document representation of sub-query request within GraphQLDataSourceProcessOptions so that it is available to RemoteGraphQLDataSource.process and RemoteGraphQLDataSource.willSendRequest [PR#1878](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1878)

## 2.0.3

- Fix bug with type extension of empty type definition [PR #1821](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1821)
- Fix output of `printSubgraphSchema` method, ensuring it can be read back by composition and `buildSubgraphSchema` [PR #1831](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1831).

- Fix bug with field covariance when the underlying plan use type-explosion [1859](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1859).

## 2.0.2

- **BREAKING**: We no longer export a `getDefaultFetcher` function. This function returned the default `fetch` implementation used to talk to Uplink (which is distinct from the default `fetch` implementation used by `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` to talk to subgraphs). It was the fetcher from `make-fetch-happen` v8 with some preset configuration relating to caching and request headers. However, the caching configuration was not actually being used when talking to Uplink (as we talk to Uplink over POST requests, and the Uplink protocol has an application-level mechanism for avoiding unnecessary large responses), and the request headers were already being provided explicitly by the Uplink client code. Since this release is also upgrading `make-fetch-happen`, it is impossible to promise that there would be no behavior change at all to the fetcher returned from `make-fetch-happen`, and as none of the preset configuration is actually relevant to the internal use of `getDefaultFetcher` (which now just uses `make-fetch-happens` without extra configuration), we have removed the function. If you were using this function, you can replace `const fetcher = getDefaultFetcher()` with `import fetcher from 'make-fetch-happen'`. [PR #1805](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1805)
- The `fetch` implementation used by default by `UplinkFetcher` and `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` is now imported from `make-fetch-happen` v10 instead of v8. The fetcher used by `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` no longer limits the number of simultaneous requests per subgraph (or specifically, per host/port pair) to 15 by default; instead, there is no limit. (If you want to restore the previous behavior, install `make-fetch-happen`, import `fetcher` from it, and pass `new RemoteGraphQLDataSource({ fetcher: fetcher.defaults(maxSockets: 15)}))` in your `buildService` option.) Note that if you invoke the `fetcher` yourself in a `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` subclass, you should ensure that you pass "plain" objects rather than `Headers` or `Request` objects, as the newer version has slightly different logic about how to recognize `Headers` and `Request` objects. We have adjusted the TypeScript types for `fetcher` so that only these "plain" objects (which result in consistent behavior across all fetcher implementations) are permitted.

## v2.0.0-alpha.5

- Reject mismatching types for interface field implementation if some of those implementations are `@external`, since this can lead to invalid subgraph queries at runtime [PR #1318](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1318). This limitation should be lifted in the future once the root cause (the invalid runtime queries) is fixed by issue [#1257](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/issues/1257).
- Fix potentially inefficient query plans with multiple `@requires` [PR #1431](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1431).
- Remove `graphql@15` from peer dependencies [PR #1472](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1472).

## v2.0.0-alpha.4

- **BREAKING**: This change improves the `supergraphSdl` configuration option to provide a clean and flexible interface for updating gateway schema on load and at runtime. This PR brings a number of updates and deprecations to the gateway. Previous options for loading the gateway's supergraph (`serviceList`, `localServiceList`, `experimental_updateServiceDefinitions`, `experimental_supergraphSdl`) are all deprecated going forward. The migration paths all point to the updated `supergraphSdl` configuration option.

The most notable change here is the introduction of the concept of a `SupergraphManager` (one new possible type of `supergraphSdl`). This interface (when implemented) provides a means for userland code to update the gateway supergraph dynamically, perform subgraph healthchecks, and access subgraph datasources. All of the mentioned deprecated configurations now either use an implementation of a `SupergraphManager` internally or export one to be configured by the user (`IntrospectAndCompose` and `LocalCompose`).

For now: all of the mentioned deprecated configurations will still continue to work as expected. Their usage will come with deprecation warnings advising a switch to `supergraphSdl`.

- `serviceList` users should switch to the now-exported `IntrospectAndCompose` class.
- `localServiceList` users should switch to the similar `LocalCompose` class.
- `experimental_{updateServiceDefinitions|supergraphSdl}` users should migrate their implementation to a custom `SupergraphSdlHook` or `SupergraphManager`.

Since the gateway itself is no longer responsible for composition:

- `experimental_didUpdateComposition` has been renamed more appropriately to `experimental_didUpdateSupergraph` (no signature change)
- `experimental_compositionDidFail` hook is removed

`experimental_pollInterval` is deprecated and will issue a warning. Its renamed equivalent is `pollIntervalInMs`.

Some defensive code around gateway shutdown has been removed which was only relevant to users who are running the gateway within `ApolloServer` before v2.18. If you are still running one of these versions, server shutdown may not happen as smoothly.

[#1246](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1246)

- Upgrading graphql dependency to `16.2.0` [PR #1129](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1129).

## v2.0.0-alpha.3

- RemoteGraphQLDataSource will now use `make-fetch-happen` by default rather than `node-fetch` [PR #1284](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1284)
- **NOOP**: Fix OOB testing w.r.t. nock hygiene. Pushed error reporting endpoint responsibilities up into the gateway class, but there should be no effect on the runtime at all. [PR #1309](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1309)
- **Multi-cloud Uplink capability** [PR #1283](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1283): now, by default two separate Uplink services will be used for schema fetching, the system will round-robin and if one service fails, a retry will occur and the other service will be called.
  - The Uplink URLs are `https://uplink.api.apollographql.com/` (GCP) and `https://aws.uplink.api.apollographql.com/` (AWS).
  - To override these defaults and configure what Uplink services, there are two options:
    - Option #1: use the existing environment variable `APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT` which will now be treated as a comma-separated list of URLs.
    - Option #2: use the new `uplinkEndpoints`, which must be single URL or a comma-separated list of URLs for the Uplink End-points to be used, and `uplinkMaxRetries` which is how many times the Uplink URLs should be retried.
  - The old `schemaConfigDeliveryEndpoint` configuration value still work, but is deprecated and will be removed in a subsequent release.
