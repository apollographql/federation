/**
 * Tests whether `maybeSubType` is a subtype of `type`.
 *
 * Subtyping is defined as the notion of "direct" subtyping (of `isDirectSubtype`) extended to wrapper types
 * and to equality. More precisely, `maybeSubType` is a subtype of `type` if one of the following is true:
 * - both types are the same.
 * - `maybeSubType` is a direct subtype of `type`.
 * - `maybeSubType` and `type` are the same kind of wrapper type (both lists or both non-null), and the
 *   type wrapped by `maybeSubType` is a subtype of the type wrapped by `type`.
 * - `maybeSubType` is a non-null type and the type wrapped by `maybeSubType` is a subtype of `type`.
 *
 * As usual, this subtyping relation ensures that if a value is of type `subType` and `subType` is a subtype
 * of `type`, then it can be used where a value of type `type` is expected.
 *
 * If you to exclude equality from the relation, use `isStrictSubtype`.
