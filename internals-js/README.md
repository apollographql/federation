# @apollo/federation-internals

Apollo Federation internal utilities. This package may ship breaking changes and does not hold the same semver guarentees as our other Federation pacakges.

If you are looking to create a subgraph in JavaScript, use [Apollo Server with @apollo/subgraph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/using-federation/apollo-subgraph-setup).

If you are looking to run a supergraph, use [Apollo Router or Apollo Gateway](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/building-supergraphs/router).

If you want to run composition locally, use the [Rover command `supergraph compose`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/commands/supergraphs#composing-a-supergraph-schema)
