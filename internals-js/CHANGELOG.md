# CHANGELOG for `@apollo/federation-internals`

## 2.7.7

### Patch Changes

- No logical changes since 2.7.5 or 2.7.6, but we fixed a bug in the release process, so we need to publish a new patch version (2.7.7). ([#2999](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2999))

## 2.7.6

## 2.7.5

## 2.7.4

### Patch Changes

- Fixed a regression created by PR (#2967), where directives would not be properly attached to their parent. (#2982) ([#2984](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2984))

## 2.7.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix a query planning bug where invalid subgraph queries are generated with `reuseQueryFragments` set true. ([#2952](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/issues/2952)) ([#2963](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2963))

- Fixed query planner to pass the directives from original query to subgraph operations (#2961) ([#2967](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2967))

## 2.7.2

### Patch Changes

- When a linked directive requires a federation version higher than the linked federation spec, upgrade to the implied version and issue a hint ([#2929](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2929))

- When auto-upgrading a subgraph (i.e. one that does not explicitly @link the federation spec) do not go past v2.4. This is so that subgraphs will not inadvertently require the latest join spec (which cause the router or gateway not to start if running an older version). ([#2933](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2933))

- Add new `generateQueryFragments` option to query planner config ([#2958](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2958))

  If enabled, the query planner will extract inline fragments into fragment definitions before sending queries to subgraphs. This can significantly reduce the size of the query sent to subgraphs, but may increase the time it takes to plan the query.

## 2.7.1

### Patch Changes

- Additional `SourceSpecDefinition` validations and bug fixes ([#2914](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2914))

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Implement progressive `@override` functionality ([#2911](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2911))

  The progressive `@override` feature brings a new argument to the `@override` directive: `label: String`. When a label is added to an `@override` application, the override becomes conditional, depending on parameters provided to the query planner (a set of which labels should be overridden). Note that this feature will be supported in router for enterprise users only.

  Out-of-the-box, the router will support a percentage-based use case for progressive `@override`. For example:

  ```graphql
  type Query {
    hello: String @override(from: "original", label: "percent(5)")
  }
  ```

  The above example will override the root `hello` field from the "original" subgraph 5% of the time.

  More complex use cases will be supported by the router via the use of coprocessors/rhai to resolve arbitrary labels to true/false values (i.e. via a feature flag service).

- Allow known `FeatureDefinition` subclasses to define custom subgraph schema validation rules ([#2910](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2910))

- Support `@join__directive(graphs, name, args)` directives ([#2894](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2894))

## 2.6.3

## 2.6.2

### Patch Changes

- Avoid `>=` comparison for `FeatureVersion` objects ([#2883](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2883))

- Fix query planning bug where `__typename` on interface object types in named fragments can cause query plan execution to fail. ([#2886](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/issues/2886)) ([#2886](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2886))

## 2.6.1

### Patch Changes

- Add missing `@policy` directive top level exports ([#2869](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2869))

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Update `license` field in `package.json` to use `Elastic-2.0` SPDX identifier ([#2741](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2741))

- Introduce the new `@policy` scope for composition ([#2818](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2818))

  > Note that this directive will only be _fully_ supported by the Apollo Router as a GraphOS Enterprise feature at runtime. Also note that _composition_ of valid `@policy` directive applications will succeed, but the resulting supergraph will not be _executable_ by the Gateway or an Apollo Router which doesn't have the GraphOS Enterprise entitlement.

  Users may now compose `@policy` applications from their subgraphs into a supergraph.

  The directive is defined as follows:

  ```graphql
  scalar federation__Policy

  directive @policy(
    policies: [[federation__Policy!]!]!
  ) on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT | INTERFACE | SCALAR | ENUM
  ```

  The `Policy` scalar is effectively a `String`, similar to the `FieldSet` type.

  In order to compose your `@policy` usages, you must update your subgraph's federation spec version to v2.6 and add the `@policy` import to your existing imports like so:

  ```graphql
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.6", import: [..., "@policy"])
  ```

## 2.5.7

## 2.5.6

### Patch Changes

- Fixing issue where redeclaration of custom scalars in a fed1 schema may cause upgrade errors ([#2809](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2809))

## 2.5.5

## 2.5.4

## 2.5.3

### Patch Changes

- Modifies the type for the argument of the `@requiresScopes` from `[federation__Scope!]!` to `[[federation__Scope!]!]!`. ([#2738](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2738))

  The `@requiresScopes` directives has been pre-emptively introduced in 2.5.0 to support an upcoming Apollo Router
  feature around scoped accesses. The argument for `@requiresScopes` in that upcoming feature is changed to accommodate a
  new semantic. Note that this technically a breaking change to the `@requiresScopes` directive definition, but as the
  full feature using that directive has been released yet, this directive cannot effectively be used and this should have
  no concrete impact.

- Fix potential assertion error for named fragment on abstract types when the abstract type does not have the same ([#2725](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2725))
  possible runtime types in all subgraphs.

  The error manifested itself during query planning with an error message of the form `Cannot normalize X at Y ...`.

- Expands over-eager merging of field fix to handle `@defer` consistently ([#2720](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2720))

  The previously committed [#2713](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2713) fixed an issue introduced by
  [#2387](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2387), ensuring that querying the same field with different
  directives applications was not merged, similar to what was/is done for fragments. But the exact behaviour slightly
  differs between fields and fragments when it comes to `@defer` in that for fragments, we never merge 2 similar fragments
  where both have `@defer`, which we do merge for fields. Or to put it more concretely, in the following query:

  ```graphq
  query Test($skipField: Boolean!) {
    x {
      ... on X @defer {
        a
      }
      ... on X @defer {
        b
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  the 2 `... on X @defer` are not merged, resulting in 2 deferred sections that can run in parallel. But following
  [#2713](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2713), query:

  ```graphq
  query Test($skipField: Boolean!) {
    x @defer {
      a
    }
    x @defer {
      b
    }
  }
  ```

  _will_ merge both `x @defer`, resulting in a single deferred section.

  This fix changes that later behaviour so that the 2 `x @defer` are not merged and result in 2 deferred sections,
  consistently with both 1) the case of fragments and 2) the behaviour prior to
  [#2387](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2387).

## 2.5.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix over-eager merging of fields with different directive applications ([#2713](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2713))

  Previously, the following query would incorrectly combine the selection set of `hello`, with both fields ending up under the `@skip` condition:

  ```graphql
  query Test($skipField: Boolean!) {
    hello @skip(if: $skipField) {
      world
    }
    hello {
      goodbye
    }
  }
  ```

  This change identifies those two selections on `hello` as unique while constructing our operation representation so they aren't merged at all, leaving it to the subgraph to handle the operation as-is.

## 2.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Reapply #2639: ([#2687](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2687))

  Try reusing named fragments in subgraph fetches even if those fragment only apply partially to the subgraph. Before this change, only named fragments that were applying entirely to a subgraph were tried, leading to less reuse that expected. Concretely, this change can sometimes allow the generation of smaller subgraph fetches.

  Additionally, resolve a bug which surfaced in the fragment optimization logic which could result in invalid/incorrect optimizations / fragment reuse.

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Do not run the full suite of graphQL validations on supergraphs and their extracted subgraphs by default in production environment. ([#2657](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2657))

  Running those validations on every updates of the schema takes a non-negligible amount of time (especially on large
  schema) and mainly only serves in catching bugs early in the supergraph handling code, and in some limited cases,
  provide slightly better messages when a corrupted supergraph is received, neither of which is worth the cost in
  production environment.

  A new `validateSupergraph` option is also introduced in the gateway configuration to force this behaviour.

- For CoreSpecDefintions that opt in, we've added the ability to tie the core spec version to a particular federation version. That means that if there's a new version of, say, the join spec, you won't necessarily get the new version in the supergraph schema if no subgraph requires it. ([#2528](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2528))

- Introduce the new `@authenticated` directive for composition ([#2644](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2644))

  > Note that this directive will only be _fully_ supported by the Apollo Router as a GraphOS Enterprise feature at runtime. Also note that _composition_ of valid `@authenticated` directive applications will succeed, but the resulting supergraph will not be _executable_ by the Gateway or an Apollo Router which doesn't have the GraphOS Enterprise entitlement.

  Users may now compose `@authenticated` applications from their subgraphs into a supergraph. This addition will support a future version of Apollo Router that enables authenticated access to specific types and fields via directive applications.

  The directive is defined as follows:

  ```graphql
  directive @authenticated on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT | INTERFACE | SCALAR | ENUM
  ```

  In order to compose your `@authenticated` usages, you must update your subgraph's federation spec version to v2.5 and add the `@authenticated` import to your existing imports like so:

  ```graphql
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.5", import: [..., "@authenticated"])
  ```

- Refactor/cleanup code that extract subgraphs schema from the supergraph during query planning. ([#2655](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2655))

- Introduce the new `@requiresScopes` directive for composition ([#2649](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2649))

  > Note that this directive will only be _fully_ supported by the Apollo Router as a GraphOS Enterprise feature at runtime. Also note that _composition_ of valid `@requiresScopes` directive applications will succeed, but the resulting supergraph will not be _executable_ by the Gateway or an Apollo Router which doesn't have the GraphOS Enterprise entitlement.

  Users may now compose `@requiresScopes` applications from their subgraphs into a supergraph. This addition will support a future version of Apollo Router that enables scoped access to specific types and fields via directive applications.

  The directive is defined as follows:

  ```graphql
  scalar federation__Scope

  directive @requiresScopes(
    scopes: [federation__Scope!]!
  ) on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT | INTERFACE | SCALAR | ENUM
  ```

  The `Scope` scalar is effectively a `String`, similar to the `FieldSet` type.

  In order to compose your `@requiresScopes` usages, you must update your subgraph's federation spec version to v2.5 and add the `@requiresScopes` import to your existing imports like so:

  ```graphql
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.5", import: [..., "@requiresScopes"])
  ```

## 2.4.10

### Patch Changes

- Revert #2639 from v2.4.9 ([#2681](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2681))

  PR #2639 attempts to resolve issues with query fragment reuse, but we've since turned up multiple issues (at least 1 of which is a regression - see #2680. For now, this reverts it until we resolve the regression for a future patch release.

## 2.4.9

### Patch Changes

- Improves query planning time in some situations where entities use multiple keys. ([#2610](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2610))

- Try reusing named fragments in subgraph fetches even if those fragment only apply partially to the subgraph. Before this change, only named fragments that were applying entirely to a subgraph were tried, leading to less reuse that expected. Concretely, this change can sometimes allow the generation of smaller subgraph fetches. ([#2639](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2639))

- Fix issue in the code to reuse fragments that, in some rare circumstances, could led to invalid queries where a named ([#2659](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2659))
  spread was use in an invalid position. If triggered, this resulted in an subgraph fetch whereby a named spread was
  used inside a sub-selection even though the spread condition did not intersect the parent type (the exact error message
  would depend on the client library used to handle subgraph fetches, but with GraphQL-js, the error message had the
  form "Fragment <F> cannot be spread here as objects of type <X> can never be of type <Y>").

- Fix regression in named fragment reuse introduced by 2.4.8 that caused fragments that were only used by other fragments ([#2648](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2648))
  to not be reused, even if they are making the overall query smaller and thus should be reused.

- Fix unnecessary busy work in the code extracting subgraphs from supergraphs. This code is executing when a new ([#2654](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2654))
  supergraph is deployed, and can impact gateway clients when it runs. This is often not a problem, but for
  large supergraphs with lots of subgraphs, an obvious inefficiency could make the code take much longer than
  it should have.

## 2.4.8

### Patch Changes

- Fix issue where subgraph fetches may have unused fragments (and are thus invalid). ([#2628](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2628))

- Fix issues in code to reuse named fragments. One of the fixed issue would manifest as an assertion error with a message ([#2619](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2619))
  looking like `Cannot add fragment of condition X (...) to parent type Y (...)`. Another would manifest itself by
  generating an invalid subgraph fetch where a field conflicts with another version of that field that is in a reused
  named fragment.

## 2.4.7

### Patch Changes

- Re-work the code use to try to reuse query named fragments to improve performance (thus sometimes improving query ([#2604](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2604))
  planning performance), to fix a possibly raised assertion error (with a message of form like `Cannot add selection of
field X to selection set of parent type Y`), and to fix a rare issue where an interface or union field was not being
  queried for all the types it should be.

## 2.4.6

### Patch Changes

- Fix assertion error in some overlapping fragment cases. In some cases, when fragments overlaps on some sub-selections ([#2594](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2594))
  and some interface field implementation relied on sub-typing, an assertion error could be raised with a message of
  the form `Cannot add selection of field X to selection set of parent type Y` and this fixes this problem.

- Fix possible fragment-related assertion error during query planning. This prevents a rare case where an assertion with a ([#2596](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2596))
  message of the form `Cannot add fragment of condition X (runtimes: ...) to parent type Y (runtimes: ...)` could fail
  during query planning.

## 2.4.5

### Patch Changes

- Supersedes v2.4.4 due to a publishing error with no dist/ folder ([#2583](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2583))

## 2.4.4

## 2.4.3

### Patch Changes

- Improves the heuristics used to try to reuse the query named fragments in subgraph fetches. Said fragment will be reused ([#2541](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2541))
  more often, which can lead to smaller subgraph queries (and hence overall faster processing).

## 2.4.2

### Patch Changes

- Allow passing print options to the `compose` method to impact how the supergraph is printed, and adds new printing ([#2042](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2042))
  options to order all elements of the schema.

- Fix potential bug when an `@interfaceObject` type has a `@requires`. When an `@interfaceObject` type has a field with a ([#2524](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2524))
  `@requires` and the query requests that field only for some specific implementations of the corresponding interface,
  then the generated query plan was sometimes invalid and could result in an invalid query to a subgraph (against a
  subgraph that rely on `@apollo/subgraph`, this lead the subgraph to produce an error message looking like `"The
_entities resolver tried to load an entity for type X, but no object or interface type of that name was found in the
schema"`).

## 2.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix issues (incorrectly rejected composition and/or subgraph errors) with `@interfaceObject`. Those issues may occur ([#2494](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2494))
  either due to some use of `@requires` in an `@interfaceObject` type, or when some subgraph `S` defines a type that is an
  implementation of an interface `I` in the supergraph, and there is an `@interfaceObject` for `I` in another subgraph,
  but `S` does not itself defines `I`.

- Fix assertion error during query planning in some cases where queries has some unsatisfiable branches (a part of the ([#2486](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2486))
  query goes through type conditions that no runtime types satisfies).

- Start building packages with TS 5.x, which should have no effect on consumers ([#2480](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2480))

- Improves reuse of named fragments in subgraph fetches. When a question has named fragments, the code tries to reuse ([#2497](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2497))
  those fragment in subgraph fetches is those can apply (so when the fragment is fully queried in a single subgraph fetch).
  However, the existing was only able to reuse those fragment in a small subset of cases. This change makes it much more
  likely that _if_ a fragment can be reused, it will be.

## 2.4.0

### Patch Changes

- Refactor the internal implementation of selection sets used by the query planner to decrease the code complexity and ([#2387](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2387))
  improve query plan generation performance in many cases.

- Revert #2293. Removing URL import causes a problem when running under deno. ([#2451](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2451))

- Use globally available URL object instead of node builtin "url" module ([#2293](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2293))

- Optimises query plan generation for parts of queries that can statically be known to not cross across subgraphs ([#2449](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2449))

## 2.4.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- Revert #2293. Removing URL import causes a problem when running under deno. ([#2451](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2451))

## 2.4.0-alpha.0

### Patch Changes

- Handle defaulted variables correctly during post-processing. ([#2443](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2443))

  Users who tried to use built-in conditional directives (skip/include) with _defaulted_ variables and no variable provided would encounter an error thrown by operation post-processing saying that the variables weren't provided. The defaulted values went unaccounted for, so the operation would validate but then fail an assertion while resolving the conditional.

  With this change, defaulted variable values are now collected and provided to post-processing (with defaults being overwritten by variables that are actually provided).

## 2.3.5
