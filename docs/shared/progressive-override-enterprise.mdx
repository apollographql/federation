<EnterpriseFeature>

Progressive `@override` is an [Enterprise feature](/router/enterprise-features) of the Apollo Router and requires an organization with a [GraphOS Enterprise plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/). It also requires Apollo Federation v2.7 or later.

If your organization _doesn't_ currently have an Enterprise plan, you can test out this functionality by signing up for a free [Enterprise trial](/graphos/org/plans/#enterprise-trials).
