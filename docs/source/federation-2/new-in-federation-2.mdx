title: Changes from Federation 1 to Federation 2
---

Apollo Federation 2 provides developer experience improvements to the original specification for Apollo Federation (called _Federation 1_ in these docs). If your organization has an existing Federation 1 graph, this article summarizes the benefits of [moving to Federation 2](./moving-to-federation-2/).

<Tip>

</Tip>

## What isn't changing?

Before covering what's new, here's what isn't changing in Federation 2:

* Most importantly, Federation 2 is backward compatible with most Federation 1 supergraphs. You can probably move your existing supergraph to use Federation 2 composition without making any changes.
    * Graphs that do require changes are graphs that should cause composition errors, but Federation 1 fails to detect them. [Learn more.](./backward-compatibility/#do-i-need-to-modify-my-subgraph-schemas-to-use-federation-2)
    * To take full advantage of Federation 2 features, you do need to make some changes to your subgraph schemas, but you can make these changes incrementally at your convenience. See [Moving to Apollo Federation 2](./moving-to-federation-2/).

* Subgraph servers have no additional requirements. Any [subgraph-compatible library](../building-supergraphs/supported-subgraphs/) is automatically compatible with Federation 2.
    * Many subgraph-compatible libraries do not yet automatically define certain directives that are new in Federation 2, such as `@shareable`. You can [define these directives manually](./moving-to-federation-2/#add-directive-definitions-if-needed) to use them in your subgraph schemas.

## More flexible composition

Federation 2 improves the flexibility and independence of your subgraph schemas. New composition logic is more flexible compared to Federation 1, meaning teams can more confidently build out their subgraphs or migrate functionality between subgraphs.

Let's look at some examples!

## Value types

In Federation 1, multiple subgraphs can define the same type, but those definitions must all be identical. These identical shared types are called _value types_:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">Fed. 1</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Subgraph A"
type Book {
  title: String!
  author: String!
}
```

```graphql title="Subgraph B"
type Book {
  title: String!
  author: String!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

In Federation 2, this "identical definition" constraint is removed. Value types and their fields can be shared across subgraphs, even if certain details differ between definitions.

For details, see the sections below, along with [Value types](../federated-types/sharing-types/).

### Objects

In Federation 2, an object type can be shared between subgraphs like so:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">Fed. 2</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Subgraph A"
type Book @shareable {
  title: String!
  author: String!
}
```

```graphql {3-4} title="Subgraph B"
type Book @shareable {
  title: String!
  author: String  # Nullable
  isbn: String!   # Not in A
}
```

</CodeColumns>

The two `Book` type definitions above differ in terms of the fields they include and the nullability of those fields. Notice also the new [`@shareable`](../federated-types/sharing-types/#using-shareable) directive, which is required to indicate that a field can be resolved by multiple subgraphs.

<Note>

Marking a type as `@shareable` (as with `Book` above) is equivalent to marking all of its fields as `@shareable`.

</Note>

This flexibility is especially helpful when an organization has multiple standalone GraphQL APIs that they want to unify with federation. Such APIs often share some types, and this added flexibility reduces the work required to compose their schemas successfully.

#### Valid shared field differences between subgraphs

* The return type of a shared field can vary in nullability (`String` / `String!`).
* Types can omit fields that are included in other subgraphs, as long as every field in your supergraph is always resolvable. (For details, see [Rules of composition](../federated-types/composition/#rules-of-composition).)

For details on how these field differences are handled, see [Differing shared fields](../federated-types/sharing-types/#differing-shared-fields).

### Enums, unions, and interfaces

In Federation 2, `enum`, `union`, and `interface` definitions can differ between subgraphs. For details, see [Merging types from multiple subgraphs](../federated-types/composition/#merging-types-from-multiple-subgraphs).

## Entities

Federation 2 introduces subtle but powerful changes to [entities](../entities/).

### Originating subgraphs

In Federation 1, an entity originates in one subgraph and is then extended in other subgraphs:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Fed. 1</strong></p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Products (originating)"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Int
}
```

```graphql title="Inventory (extending)"
extend type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
  inStock: Boolean!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

In Federation 2, entities don't have an "originating subgraph." Instead, each subgraph can define an entity and contribute fields to it:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Fed. 2</strong></p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Products"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Int
}
```

```graphql title="Inventory"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  inStock: Boolean!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

For details, see [Contributing entity fields](../entities/#contributing-entity-fields).

### Shared entity fields

In Federation 1, each entity field is resolved by exactly one subgraph (unless it's a `@key` field or part of a `@provides` directive). In Federation 2, multiple subgraphs can resolve the same entity field if they all mark it with the `@shareable` directive:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Fed. 2</strong></p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql {3} title="Products"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @shareable
  price: Int
}
```

```graphql {3} title="Inventory"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @shareable
  inStock: Boolean!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

For more information, see [Resolving another subgraph's field](../entities-advanced/#resolving-another-subgraphs-field).

### Changes to `@key`

Federation 2 adds a new optional argument to the `@key` directive: `resolvable`. You can set this argument to `false` to indicate that a particular subgraph doesn't define a [reference resolver](../entities/#2-define-a-reference-resolver) for that entity.

For example:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Fed. 2</strong></p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Products"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Int
}
```

```graphql {1} title="Reviews"
type Product @key(fields: "id", resolvable: false) {
  id: ID!
}

type Review {
  product: Product!
  score: Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

In this case, the Reviews subgraph references the `Product` entity by using it as the return type for `Review.product`. However, the subgraph doesn't contribute any unique fields to `Product`, so it doesn't need to define a reference resolver for it. Therefore, the "stub" definition of `Product` in the Reviews subgraph can include `resolvable: false`.

For more information, see [Referencing an entity without contributing fields](../entities/#referencing-an-entity-without-contributing-fields).

### Migrating fields

Federation 2 introduces the [`@override` directive](../federated-types/federated-directives/#override), which helps you safely migrate entity and root-level fields between subgraphs with managed federation:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Payments subgraph"
type Bill @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  amount: Int!
}

type Payment {
  # ...
}
```

```graphql {3} title="Billing subgraph"
type Bill @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  amount: Int! @override(from: "Payments")
}
```

</CodeColumns>

For details, see [Entity migration](../entities-advanced/#migrating-entities-and-fields).

## Interfaces implementing interfaces

Federation 1 composition incorrectly fails if an interface type implements another interface. This issue is resolved in Federation 2:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Fed. 2</strong></p>

```graphql
interface Media {
  title: String!
}

interface Book implements Media {
  title: String!
  author: String!
}
```
