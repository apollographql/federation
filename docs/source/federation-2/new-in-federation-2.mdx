> ⚠️ **Apollo Federation 2 is in public preview.** It is not yet feature-complete, and breaking changes might occur between this release and general availability. [Learn about release stages.](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/resources/release-stages/#open-source-release-stages)

**Apollo Federation 2** provides developer experience improvements to the original specification for Apollo Federation (called **Federation 1** in these docs). If your organization has an existing Federation 1 graph, this article summarizes the upcoming benefits of [moving to Federation 2](./moving-to-federation-2/).

If you're just getting started with Federation, check out the [Quickstart](../quickstart/setup/).

## What _isn't_ changing?

Before covering what's new, here's what _isn't_ changing in Federation 2:

* Most importantly, **Federation 2 is backward compatible with most Federation 1 graphs.** You can probably move your existing graph to Federation 2 without needing to make any changes.
    * Graphs that _do_ require changes are graphs that _should_ cause composition errors, but Federation 1 fails to detect them. [Learn more.](./backward-compatibility/#do-i-need-to-modify-my-subgraph-schemas-for-federation-2)

* Subgraph servers have _no_ additional requirements. Any [subgraph-compatible library](../other-servers/) is automatically compatible with Federation 2.

## More flexible composition

**Federation 2 improves the flexibility and independence of your subgraph schemas.** New composition logic is more flexible compared to Federation 1, meaning teams can more confidently build out their subgraphs or migrate functionality between subgraphs.

Let's look at some examples!

## Type and field sharing

In Federation 1, multiple subgraphs can define the same type, but those definitions must all be _identical_. These identical shared types are called **value types**:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">Fed. 1</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Book {
  title: String!
  author: String!
}
```

```graphql
# Subgraph B
type Book {
  title: String!
  author: String!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

In Federation 2, this "identical definition" constraint is removed. Types and their fields can be shared across subgraphs, even if _certain_ details differ between definitions. With this change, the term "value type" is not used in Federation 2.

Let's look at some examples!

### Objects and interfaces

In Federation 2, an object or interface type can be shared between subgraphs like so:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">Fed. 2</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Book @shareable {
  title: String!
  author: String!
}
```

```graphql{4-5}
# Subgraph B
type Book @shareable {
  title: String!
  author: String  # Nullable
  isbn: String!   # Not in A
}
```

</CodeColumns>

The two `Book` type definitions above differ in terms of the fields they include and the nullability of those fields. Notice also the `@shareable` directive, which indicates that a type or field is allowed to be defined in multiple subgraphs.

This flexibility is especially helpful when an organization has multiple standalone GraphQL APIs that they want to unify with federation. Such APIs often share some types, and this added flexibility reduces the work required to compose their schemas successfully.

#### Valid field differences between subgraphs

* The return type of a field can vary in nullability (`String` / `String!`).
* Types can omit fields that are included in _other_ subgraphs, as long as every field in your supergraph is always **resolvable**. (For details, see [Rules of composition](../federated-types/composition/#rules-of-composition).)

> For details on how these field differences are handled, see [Sharing types](../federated-types/value-types/).

### Enums and unions

In Federation 2, shared enum and union definitions can differ between subgraphs. For details, see [Enums and unions](../federated-types/value-types/#enums-and-unions).
