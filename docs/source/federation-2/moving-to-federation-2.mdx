title: Moving to Apollo Federation 2
---

This article describes how to move an existing Federation 1 graph to Apollo Federation 2. If you haven't yet, [see what's new in Federation 2.](./new-in-federation-2/)

There are two high-level phases for moving to Federation 2:

1. Use Federation 2 composition logic with your _unmodified_ Federation 1  subgraph schemas.
2. Modify your Federation 1 subgraph schemas to convert them to true Federation 2 subgraph schemas.

Phase 1 requires very few changes, and it's straightforward to move _back_ to Federation 1 after making them. However, Phase 2 requires schema changes that _remove_ backward compatibility with Federation 1. Because of this, we strongly recommend moving a test instance of your graph to Federation 2 first.

## Phase 1: Use new composition logic

### Update `@apollo/gateway`

Update your gateway's `@apollo/gateway` library to version `2.0.0` or later. This enables your gateway to interact with supergraph schemas composed with Federation 2 logic.

You can install the latest gateway with the following command:

```bash
npm install @apollo/gateway
```

These updated versions of `@apollo/gateway` continue to support Federation 1, so you can deploy this update without breaking your existing graph.

### Configure your composition method

Federation 2 uses [more flexible rules](./new-in-federation-2/#more-flexible-composition) for schema composition. Follow the instructions for your current composition method:

<ExpansionPanel title="Using the Rover CLI">

If you perform composition with the Rover CLI, do the following:

1. Install the latest version of Rover (must be `0.5.0` or later) using the appropriate command for your system:

    ```bash title="MacOS / Unix-like"
    curl -sSL https://rover.apollo.dev/nix/latest | sh
    ```

    ```bash title="Windows"
    iwr 'https://rover.apollo.dev/win/latest' | iex
    ```

2. Open the YAML `--config` file you provide to `rover supergraph compose` and add the following line to the top:

    ```yaml title="supergraph-config.yaml"
    federation_version: 2
    ```

That's it! You can now perform Federation 2 composition with the same command you've used for Federation 1:

```bash
rover supergraph compose --config ./supergraph.yaml
```

</ExpansionPanel>


<ExpansionPanel title="Using managed federation">

If you're using [managed federation](../managed-federation/overview/), you move individual variants of your graph to Federation 2 in the Apollo Studio UI.

Go to your graph's Settings page and open the Variants section:

<img class="screenshot" alt="Edit supported directives in Studio" src="../images/edit-build-configuration.jpg" width="600"/>

Click **Edit Build Configuration** for the variant you want to move to Federation 2. The following dialog appears:

<img class="screenshot" alt="Edit supported directives in Studio" src="../images/set-federation-version.jpg" width="600"/>

In the Federation Version dropdown, select **Federation 2** and click **Save**.

Studio automatically begins composing your supergraph schema using Federation 2 composition logic. Your updated managed gateway automatically fetches the updated schema when it next polls Apollo:

```mermaid
graph LR;
  subgraph "Your infrastructure"
  serviceA[Products<br/>subgraph];
  serviceB[Reviews<br/>subgraph];
  gateway([Gateway]);
  end
  subgraph "Apollo cloud"
    registry{{Apollo Schema<br/>Registry}};
    uplink{{Apollo<br/>Uplink}}
  end
  serviceA & serviceB -->|Publishes<br/>schema| registry;
  registry -->|Updates<br/>supergraph config| uplink;
  gateway -->|Polls for supergraph changes| uplink;
  class registry secondary;
  class uplink secondary;
```

</ExpansionPanel>

## Phase 2: Modify subgraph schemas

Your unmodified Federation 1 graph is now using Federation 2 composition! The natural next question is, "What does this change about my graph's behavior?" And right now, the answer is: nothing!

> If your graph is _not_ successfully composing with Federation 2, see [Breaking changes](./backward-compatibility/#breaking-changes) for the most common causes.

If you want to take full advantage of Federation 2 features like improved control for type sharing, you now need to make some changes to your subgraph schemas.

**You can update your subgraph schemas one at a time!** The steps below describe how to modify a single subgraph schema for Federation 2, and you can perform these steps for a given subgraph whenever's convenient for your team.

### Opt in to Federation 2

First, add the following definition to your subgraph schema:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0",
        import: ["@key", "@shareable"])
```

This definition identifies a schema as a true Federation 2 schema, and it `import`s any federation-specific directives that the schema uses.

> **Important:** Most subgraph schemas use the `@key` and `@shareable` directives, so we've included them in the snippet above. Depending on your schema, you might need to add other federated directives to the `import` array, such as `@external` or `@provides`.
>
> [See all Federation-specific directives.](../federated-types/federated-directives/)

_Without_ the above definition, the composition process assumes a subgraph schema is a Federation 1 schema, and it applies intelligent defaults to support backward compatibility.

#### Update `@apollo/subgraph`

If your subgraphs use Apollo Server and the `@apollo/subgraph` library, also update `@apollo/subgraph` to version `2.0.0` or later:

```bash
npm install @apollo/subgraph
```

This adds built-in support for new federation directives, such as `@shareable`.

### Add schema definitions to non-Apollo subgraphs

Currently, only Apollo Server using `@apollo/subgraph` adds some required definitions to your subgraph schemas automatically. If you're using any other [supported subgraph libraries](../other-servers/), you need to add the following definitions to those subgraph schemas:

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand">

```graphql
directive @shareable on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT

scalar link__Import

directive @link(
  url: String!,
  import: [link__Import],
) repeatable on SCHEMA
```

</ExpansionPanel>

We'll be working with library maintainers to help automatically add these schema definitions in libraries besides `@apollo/subgraph`.

### Mark all value types as `@shareable`

By default in Federation 2, most schema fields are resolvable by only a _single subgraph_. In Federation 1, this is _not_ true for [value types](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/value-types/):

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Fed. 1</strong> (invalid in Fed. 2)</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Subgraph A"
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

```graphql title="Subgraph B"
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

For both subgraphs to resolve the above fields in Federation 2, the `@shareable` directive is required in both schemas:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">Fed. 2</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql {2-3} title="Subgraph A"
type Position {
  x: Int! @shareable
  y: Int! @shareable
}
```

```graphql {2-3} title="Subgraph B"
type Position {
  x: Int! @shareable
  y: Int! @shareable
}
```

</CodeColumns>

> You can also apply `@shareable` directly to a type definition (such as `Position` above). This is equivalent to applying `@shareable` to _all_ of that type's fields.

For more details, see [Value types](../federated-types/sharing-types/).

### Update entity definitions

Federation 2 introduces subtle but powerful changes to [entities](../entities/). These changes require corresponding updates to their definitions in your subgraph schemas.

#### Remove unnecessary syntax

In Federation 1, an entity originates in _one_ subgraph, and then other subgraphs _extend_ the entity to add fields:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Fed. 1</strong></p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Products (originating)"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Int
}
```

```graphql title="Inventory (extending)"
extend type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
  inStock: Boolean!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

In Federation 2, entities no longer have an originating subgraph. Instead, each subgraph can define an entity and contribute fields to it:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Fed. 2</strong></p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Products"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Int
}
```

```graphql {1-2} title="Inventory"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  inStock: Boolean!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Note the following in the Federation 2 subgraphs above:

* The Inventory subgraph no longer `extend`s the `Product` entity.
* The Inventory subgraph no longer marks the `Product.id` field as `@external`.
    * The `@external` directive is no longer required for `@key` fields, but it _is_ still required for [`@requires`](../entities-advanced/#contributing-computed-entity-fields) and [`@provides`](../entities-advanced/#using-provides).
* Both subgraphs can resolve `Product.id`, even though it isn't marked as `@shareable`!
    * Unlike most fields, `@key` fields such as `Product.id` are `@shareable` by default. This is necessary for `@key` fields, because the gateway uses them to associate data from different subgraphs with the same object.

#### Mark `@provides` fields as `@shareable`

The `@provides` directive enables a subgraph to resolve a particular field _only_ for specific query paths. It's supported in Federation 2 as it is in Federation 1.

However, if a subgraph `@provides` a particular field, that field must be marked as `@shareable` in each subgraph where it's _always_ resolvable:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Fed. 2</strong></p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql {3} title="Products"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @shareable
  price: Int
}
```

```graphql {3,8} title="Inventory"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @external
  inStock: Boolean!
}

type Query {
  outOfStockProducts: [Product!]! @provides(fields: "name")
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Here, `Query.outOfStockProducts` in the Inventory subgraph `@provides` the `Product.name` field. Therefore, that field must be marked as `@shareable` in the Products subgraph (and `@external` in the Inventory subgraph, as in Federation 1). Otherwise, a composition error occurs.

#### Modify `@key`s for entity stubs

In certain cases, a subgraph _references_ an entity without contributing any fields to it. In Federation 1, these cases look like the following:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Fed. 1</strong></p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Products"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Int
}
```

```graphql {1-3,6} title="Reviews"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
}

type Review {
  product: Product!
  score: Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

The Reviews subgraph above uses `Product` as the return type of the `Review.product` field, so it needs to define a "stub" of the `Product` entity. This stub includes just enough information to identify a unique instance.

In Federation 2, stubs like `Product` should include `resolvable: false` in their `@key` arguments, like so:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Fed. 2</strong></p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Products"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Int
}
```

```graphql {1} title="Reviews"
type Product @key(fields: "id", resolvable: false) {
  id: ID!
}

type Review {
  product: Product!
  score: Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Setting `resolvable: false` tells the gateway that a subgraph doesn't define a reference resolver for a particular entity. This is most common when [referencing an entity without contributing fields to it](../entities/#referencing-an-entity-without-contributing-fields).
