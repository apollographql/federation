title: Composition hints
---

When you successfully [compose](./federated-types/composition) the schemas provided by your [subgraphs](./building-supergraphs/subgraphs-overview/) into a supergraph schema, the composition process can flag potential improvements. Specifically, composition can output violations of the [GraphOS schema linter's](/graphos/delivery/schema-linter) [composition rules](/graphos/delivery/linter-rules#composition-rules) in GraphOS Studio or via the [Rover CLI](/rover/).

The [`rover subgraph check`](/rover/commands/subgraphs#subgraph-check) command outputs rule violations with the [severity levels](/graphos/delivery/schema-linter/#setting-severity-levels) you've configured for your graph variant. The [`rover supergraph compose`](/rover/commands/supergraphs#supergraph-compose) command outputs rule violations for all local subgraph schemas. 

See below for a list of composition rules categorized by rule type. The heading for each rule is the code that GraphOS returns for the rule violation. Refer to the [rules reference page](/graphos/delivery/linter-rules) for a comprehensive list of linter rules.
