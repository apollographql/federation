description: Learn about hints flagged during Apollo Federation schema composition using GraphOS Studio or the Rover CLI.

When you successfully compose your subgraph schemas into a supergraph schema, the composition process can flag potential improvements or hints. Hints are violations of the [GraphOS schema linter's](/graphos/platform/schema-management/linting) [composition rules](/graphos/platform/schema-management/linting/rules#composition-rules). You can review them on the [Checks](/graphos/platform/schema-management/checks) page in GraphOS Studio or via the [Rover CLI](/rover/).

<Note>

Composition hints only appear in GraphOS Studio and via the `rover subgraph check` command for graphs on [federation version `2.4`](/federation/federation-versions/#v24) or later. You can update a graph's version from its **Settings** page in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content).

</Note>

The [`rover subgraph check`](/rover/commands/subgraphs#subgraph-check) command outputs rule violations with the [severity levels](/graphos/platform/schema-management/linting/#setting-severity-levels) you've configured for your graph variant. The [`rover supergraph compose`](/rover/commands/supergraphs#supergraph-compose) command outputs rule violations for all local subgraph schemas.

See below for a list of composition rules categorized by rule type. The heading for each rule is the code that GraphOS returns for the rule violation. Refer to the [rules reference page](/graphos/platform/schema-management/linting/rules) for a comprehensive list of linter rules.
