This article describes how to create a **subgraph** for a federated graph using Apollo Server.

## Defining a subgraph

> To be part of a supergraph, a subgraph must conform to the [Apollo Federation subgraph specification](/federation-spec/), which exposes the subgraph's capabilities to the gateway, as well as to tools like Apollo Studio.

Converting an existing monolithic graph into a single subgraph is a convenient first step in building a federated supergraph. To start, here's a *non-federated* Apollo Server setup:

```javascript:title=index.js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me() {
      return { id: "1", username: "@ava" }
    }
  }
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

server.listen(4001).then(({ url }) => {
    console.log(`🚀 Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

This should look familiar if you've [set up Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/) before. If it doesn't, we recommend you familiarize yourself with the basics before jumping into federation.

Now, let's convert this to a subgraph. The first step is to install the `@apollo/subgraph` package in our project:

```shell
npm install @apollo/subgraph
```

### Defining an entity

As part of our federated architecture, we want _other_ subgraphs to be able to extend the `User` type this subgraph defines. To enable this, we add the `@key` directive to the `User` type's definition to designate it as an [entity](./entities/):

```js:title=index.js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');
const { buildSubgraphSchema } = require('@apollo/subgraph');

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;
```

The `@key` directive tells other subgraphs which field(s) of the `User` type to use to uniquely identify a particular instance. In this case, subgraphs should use the single field `id`.

Next, we add a **reference resolver** for the `User` type. A reference resolver tells the gateway how to fetch an entity by its `@key` fields:

```js:title=index.js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me() {
      return { id: "1", username: "@ava" }
    }
  },
  User: {
    __resolveReference(user, { fetchUserById }){
      return fetchUserById(user.id)
    }
  }
};
```

(This example requires defining the `fetchUserById` function to obtain the appropriate `User` from our backing data store.)

### Generating a subgraph schema

Finally, we use the `buildSubgraphSchema` function from the `@apollo/subgraph` package to augment our schema definition with federation support. We provide the result of this function to the `ApolloServer` constructor:

```js:title=index.js
const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema: buildSubgraphSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers })
});

server.listen(4001).then(({ url }) => {
    console.log(`🚀 Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

The server is now ready to act as a subgraph in a federated graph!

### Combined example

Here are the snippets above combined (again, note that for this sample to be complete, you must define the `fetchUserById` function for your data source):

```js:title=index.js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');
const { buildSubgraphSchema } = require('@apollo/subgraph');

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me() {
      return { id: "1", username: "@ava" }
    }
  },
  User: {
    __resolveReference(user, { fetchUserById }){
      return fetchUserById(user.id)
    }
  }
}

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema: buildSubgraphSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers })
});

server.listen(4001).then(({ url }) => {
    console.log(`🚀 Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

## Securing your subgraphs

Because of the power and flexibility of the [`Query._entities` and `Query._service` fields](#subgraph-specific-fields), your subgraphs should **not** be directly accessible by clients. Instead, only your [gateway](./gateway/) should have access to your subgraphs. Clients then communicate with the gateway:

<FederationArchitecture />

Make sure to implement any necessary firewall rules, access control
lists, or other measures to ensure that individual subgraphs can
be accessed _only_ via the gateway.

## Subgraph-specific fields

When you [generate your subgraph schema](#generating-a-subgraph-schema), some federation-specific definitions are automatically added to it. In addition to directive definitions like `@key`, the most useful of these definitions for debugging are two fields of the `Query` type: `_service` and `_entities`:

```graphql
type Query {
  # ...your field definitions...

  # Added automatically
  _service: _Service!
  _entities(representations: [_Any!]!): [_Entity]!
}
```

### `Query._service`

This field returns a `_Service` object with one field of its own: `sdl`. You can query it like so:

```graphql
query GetSubgraphSchema {
  _service {
    sdl
  }
}
```

The `sdl` field returns your subgraph's schema as an SDL string. This field has a couple of important differences from a standard [introspection query](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) that a tool like Apollo Sandbox uses:

* Unlike introspection, the `sdl` field is _not_ disabled by default in production environments (this is safe if you properly [secure your subgraph](#securing-your-subgraphs)).
* Unlike introspection, the `sdl` field's returned string includes federation-specific directives like `@key`.

### `Query._entities`

> [Learn about entities](./entities/) if you haven't yet.

This field takes a list of **entity representations** and returns a list of corresponding entities.

> Whenever one subgraph references _another_ subgraph's entity, it uses an **entity representation** to do so. An entity representation is an object that includes _only_ the entity's `__typename` and the fields in the entity's `@key`.

```graphql
_entities(representations: [_Any!]!): [_Entity]!
```

* The `_Any` type is a special scalar that enables you to provide entity representations of any valid shape.
* The `_Entity` type is a generated [union type](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/unions-interfaces/#union-type) that includes every entity defined in your subgraph's schema.

You can query this field like so, providing a value for the `$representations` variable as shown:

```graphql:title=Query
query ($representations: [_Any!]!) {
  _entities(representations: $representations) {
    ... on User {
      id
      username
    }
  }
}
```

```json:title=Variable
{
  "representations": [
    {
      "__typename": "User",
      "id": "5"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Using in tests and debugging

If you're writing integration tests for your subgraph, you can test the return value of the `_entities` field for various entity representations that your _other_ subgraphs use.

If you're developing your subgraph in your local environment, you can [mock the return value](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/testing/mocking/) of the `_entities` field for your _other_ subgraphs so you don't have to connect those subgraphs to their respective data stores.
