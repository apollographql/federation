description: Reference and extend types across subgraphs
---

In Apollo Federation, an **entity** is an object type that you define canonically in _one_ subgraph and can then reference and extend in _other_ subgraphs.

Entities are the core building block of a federated graph.

## Defining entities

In a GraphQL schema, you can designate any object type as an entity by adding a `@key` directive to its definition, like so:

```graphql {1} title="products"
type Product @key(fields: "upc") {
  upc: String!
  name: String!
  price: Int
}
```

> Types _besides_ object types (such as unions and interfaces) _cannot_ be entities.


The `@key` directive defines the entity's **primary key**, which consists of one or more of the type's `fields`. Like primary keys in other systems, an entity's primary key **must** uniquely identify a particular instance of that entity.

In the example above, the `Product` entity's primary key is its `upc` field. The gateway uses an entity's primary key to match data from different subgraphs to the _same_ object instance.

> An entity's `@key` cannot include fields that return a union or interface.

### Multiple primary keys

You can define more than one primary key for an entity, when applicable.

In the following example, a `Product` entity can be uniquely identified by either its `upc` _or_ its `sku`:

```graphql {1} title="products"
type Product @key(fields: "upc") @key(fields: "sku") {
  upc: String!
  sku: String!
  price: String
}
```

This pattern is helpful when different subgraphs interact with different fields of an entity. For example, a `reviews` subgraph might refer to products by their UPC, whereas an `inventory` subgraph might use SKUs.

### Compound primary keys

A single primary key can consist of multiple fields, and even nested fields.

The following example shows a primary key that consists of both a user's `id` _and_ the `id` of that user's associated organization:

```graphql {1} title="directory"
type User @key(fields: "id organization { id }") {
  id: ID!
  organization: Organization!
}

type Organization {
  id: ID!
}
```

## Referencing entities

After you define an entity in one subgraph, _other_ subgraphs can then reference that entity in their schema.

For example, let's say we have a `products` subgraph that defines the following `Product` entity:

```graphql title="products"
type Product @key(fields: "upc") {
  upc: String!
  name: String!
  price: Int
}
```

A `reviews` subgraph can then add a field of type `Product` to its `Review` type, like so:

```graphql {3} title="reviews"
type Review {
  score: Int!
  product: Product!
}

# This is a required "stub" of the Product entity (see below)
extend type Product @key(fields: "upc") {
  upc: String! @external
}
```

To reference an entity that originates in another subgraph, the `reviews` subgraph needs to define a **stub** of that entity to make its own schema valid. The stub includes just enough information for the subgraph to know how to uniquely identify a particular `Product`:

* The `extend` keyword indicates that `Product` is an entity that's defined in another subgraph.
* The `@key` directive indicates that `Product` uses the `upc` field as its primary key. This value must match the value of **exactly one** `@key` defined in the entity's _originating_ subgraph (even if the entity defines [_multiple_ primary keys](#multiple-primary-keys)).
* The `upc` field must be present because it's part of the specified `@key`. It also requires the `@external` directive to indicate that it originates in another subgraph.

This explicit syntax has several benefits:
* It's standard GraphQL grammar.
* It enables you to run the `reviews` subgraph standalone with a valid schema, including a `Product` type with a single `upc` field.
* It provides strong typing information that lets you catch mistakes at schema composition time.

## Resolving entities

Let's say our `reviews` subgraph from [Referencing entities](#referencing-entities) defines the following `Query` type:

```graphql title="reviews"
type Query {
  latestReviews: [Review!]
}
```

That means the following query is valid against our federated graph:

```graphql {6}
query GetReviewsAndProducts {
  latestReviews {
    score
    product {
      upc
      price # Not defined in reviews!
    }
  }
}
```

Now we have a problem: this query starts its execution in the `reviews` subgraph (where `latestReviews` is defined), but that subgraph _doesn't_ know that `Product` entities have a `price` field! Remember, the `reviews` subgraph only knows about its **stub** fields of `Product`.

Because of this, the gateway needs to fetch `price` from the `products` subgraph instead. But how does the gateway know _which_ products it needs to fetch the prices for?

To solve this, we add a resolver to _each_ subgraph:

* A resolver in `reviews` to generate [representations](#entity-representations) of `Product` entities
* A [reference resolver](#reference-resolvers) in `products` to return full `Product` objects from representations

### Entity representations

In our example, the `reviews` subgraph needs to define a resolver for its stub version of the `Product` entity. The `reviews` subgraph doesn't know much about `Product`s, but fortunately, it doesn't need to. All it needs to do is return data for the fields it _does_ know about, like so:

```js {3-10} title="resolvers.js"
// Reviews subgraph
const resolvers = {
  Review: {
    product(review) {
      return {
        __typename: "Product",
         upc: review.upc
      };
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```

This resolver's return value is a **representation** of a `Product` entity (because it _represents_ an entity from another subgraph). A representation always consists of:

* A `__typename` field
* Values for the entity's primary key fields (`upc` in this example)

Because an entity can be uniquely identified by its primary key fields, this is all the information the gateway needs to fetch additional fields for a `Product` object.

### Reference resolvers

As a reminder, here's the example query we're executing across our subgraphs:

```graphql {6}
query GetReviewsAndProducts {
  latestReviews {
    score
    product {
      upc
      price # Not defined in reviews!
    }
  }
}
```

The gateway knows it can't fetch `Product.price` from the `reviews` subgraph, so _first_ it executes the following query on `reviews`:

```graphql {4-7}
query {
  latestReviews {
    score
    product { # List of Product representations
      __typename
      upc
    }
  }
}
```

Notice that this query _omits_ `price` but _adds_ `__typename`, even though it wasn't in the original query string! This is because the gateway knows it needs _all_ of the fields in each `Product`'s representation, including `__typename`.

With these representations available, the gateway can now execute a _second_ query on the `products` subgraph to fetch each product's `price`. To support this special query, the `products` subgraph needs to define a **reference resolver** for the `Product` entity:

```js {4-6} title="resolvers.js"
// Products subgraph
const resolvers = {
  Product: {
    __resolveReference(reference) {
      return fetchProductByUPC(reference.upc);
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```

> In the example above, `fetchProductByUPC` is a hypothetical function that fetches a `Product`'s full details from a data store based on its `upc`.

A reference resolver (always called `__resolveReference`) provides the gateway direct access to a particular entity's fields, without needing to use a custom query to reach that entity. To use a reference resolver, the gateway must provide a valid [entity representation](#entity-representations), which is why we created the resolver in the `reviews` subgraph first!

> To learn more about `__resolveReference`, see the [API docs](./api/apollo-subgraph/#__resolvereference).

After fetching the `price` field from `products` via a reference resolver, the gateway can intelligently merge the data it obtained from its two queries into a single result and return that result to the querying client.

## Extending entities

A subgraph can add fields to an entity that's defined in another subgraph. This is called **extending** the entity.

When a subgraph extends an entity, the entity's _originating_ subgraph is not aware of the added fields. Only the _extending_ subgraph (along with the gateway) knows about these fields.

> Each field of an entity should be defined in exactly one subgraph. Otherwise, a schema composition error will occur.

### Example #1

Let's say we want to add a `reviews` field to the `Product` entity. This field will return a list of reviews for the product. The `Product` entity originates in the `products` subgraph, but it makes more sense for the `reviews` subgraph to resolve this particular field.

To handle this case, we can extend the `Product` entity in the `reviews` subgraph, like so:

```graphql {3} title="reviews"
extend type Product @key(fields: "upc") {
  upc: String! @external
  reviews: [Review]
}
```

This definition is nearly identical to the stub we defined for the `Product` type in [Referencing entities](#referencing-entities). All we've added is the `reviews` field. We _don't_ include an `@external` directive, because this field _does_ originate in the `reviews` subgraph.

Whenever a subgraph extends an entity with a new field, it's also responsible for _resolving_ that field. The gateway is automatically aware of this responsibility. In our example:

1. The gateway first fetches the `upc` field for each `Product` from the `products` subgraph.
2. The gateway then passes those `upc` values to the `reviews` subgraph, where you can access them on the object passed to your `Product.reviews` resolver:

```js
{
  Product: {
    reviews(product) {
      return fetchReviewsForProduct(product.upc);
    }
  }
}
```

### Example #2

Let's say we want to be able to query for the `inStock` status of a product. That information lives in an `inventory` subgraph, so we'll add the type extension there:

```graphql {3} title="inventory"
extend type Product @key(fields: "upc") {
  upc: ID! @external
  inStock: Boolean
}
```

```js
{
  Product: {
    inStock(product): {
      return fetchInStockStatusForProduct(product.upc);
    }
  }
}
```

Similar to the previous example, the gateway fetches the required `upc` field from the `products` subgraph and passes it to the `inventory` subgraph, even if the query didn't ask for the `upc`:

```graphql
# This query fetches upc from the products subgraph even though
# it isn't a requested field. Otherwise, the inventory subgraph
# can't know which products to return the inStock status for.
query GetTopProductAvailability {
  topProducts {
    name
    inStock
  }
}
```

## The `Query` and `Mutation` types

In Apollo Federation, the `Query` and `Mutation` base types originate in the graph composition itself and _all_ of your subgraphs are automatically treated as [extending](#extending-entities) these types to add the operations they support without explicitly adding the `extends` keyword.

For example, the `products` subgraph might extend the root `Query` type to add a `topProducts` query, like so:

```graphql title="products"
type Query {
  topProducts(first: Int = 5): [Product]
}
```

## Migrating entities and fields (advanced)

As your federated graph grows, you might decide that you want an entity (or a particular field of an entity) to originate in a different subgraph. This section describes how to perform these migrations.

### Entity migration

Let's say our Payments subgraph defines a `Bill` entity:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Payments subgraph
type Bill @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  amount: Int!
}

type Payment {
  # ...
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Then, we add a dedicated Billing subgraph to our federated graph. It now makes sense for the `Bill` entity to originate in the Billing subgraph instead. When we're done migrating, we want our deployed subgraph schemas to look like this:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Payments subgraph
type Payment {
  # ...
}
```

```graphql
# Billing subgraph
type Bill @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  amount: Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

The exact steps depend on how you perform schema composition:

<ExpansionPanel title="With Rover CLI composition">

1. In the Billing subgraph's schema, define the `Bill` entity just as it's defined in the Payments subgraph (do _not_ extend it):

    <CodeColumns>

    ```graphql
    # Payments subgraph
    type Bill @key(fields: "id") {
      id: ID!
      amount: Int!
    }

    type Payment {
      # ...
    }
    ```

    ```graphql {2-5}
    # Billing subgraph
    type Bill @key(fields: "id") {
      id: ID!
      amount: Int!
    }
    ```

    </CodeColumns>

    * Note that if you perform composition at this point, it produces an error because the `Bill` entity can't originate in more than one subgraph. That's okay! We aren't running composition yet, and we'll resolve this error in a couple of steps.

2. In the Billing subgraph, define resolvers for each field of `Bill` that currently originates in the Payments subgraph. This subgraph should resolve those fields with the exact same logic as the resolvers in the Payments subgraph.

3. Deploy the updated Billing subgraph to your environment.

    * Again, this technically deploys a composition error. However, your gateway isn't aware of this! It's still using the original supergraph schema, which indicates that `Bill` originates only in the Payments subgraph.

4. In the Payments subgraph, remove the `Bill` entity and its associated resolvers (**do not deploy this change yet**):

    <CodeColumns>

    ```graphql
    # Payments subgraph
    type Payment {
      # ...
    }
    ```

    ```graphql
    # Billing subgraph
    type Bill @key(fields: "id") {
      id: ID!
      amount: Int!
    }
    ```

    </CodeColumns>

    * This takes care of the composition error in your local environment.

5. Compose an updated supergraph schema with your usual configuration using `rover supergraph compose`.
    * This updated supergraph schema indicates that `Bill` originates in the Billing subgraph.

6. Assuming CI completes successfully, deploy an updated version of your _gateway_ with the new supergraph schema.
    * When this deployment completes, the gateway begins resolving `Bill` fields in the Billing subgraph _instead of_ the Payments subgraph.

7. Deploy an updated version of your Payments subgraph without the `Bill` entity.
    * At this point it's safe to remove this definition, because the gateway is never resolving `Bill` with the Payments subgraph.

We're done! `Bill` now originates in a new subgraph, and it was resolvable during each step of the migration process.

</ExpansionPanel>

<ExpansionPanel title="With managed federation">

1. In the Billing subgraph's schema, define the `Bill` entity just as it's defined in the Payments subgraph (do _not_ extend it):

    <CodeColumns>

    ```graphql
    # Payments subgraph
    type Bill @key(fields: "id") {
      id: ID!
      amount: Int!
    }

    type Payment {
      # ...
    }
    ```

    ```graphql {2-5}
    # Billing subgraph
    type Bill @key(fields: "id") {
      id: ID!
      amount: Int!
    }
    ```

    </CodeColumns>

2. Publish the updated Billing subgraph schema to Apollo.

    * Note that you're publishing a composition error, because the `Bill` entity now originates in more than one subgraph. This creates a failed [launch](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/launches/) in Apollo Studio. That's okay! Apollo Uplink continues to serve the most recent _valid_ supergraph schema to your gateway.

3. In the Billing subgraph, define resolvers for each field of `Bill` that currently originates in the Payments subgraph. This subgraph should resolve those fields with the exact same logic as the resolvers in the Payments subgraph.

4. Deploy the updated Billing subgraph to your environment.

    * This change is invisible to your gateway, which is not yet aware that the Billing subgraph defines the `Bill` entity.

5. In the Payments subgraph, remove the `Bill` entity and its associated resolvers:

    <CodeColumns>

    ```graphql
    # Payments subgraph
    type Payment {
      # ...
    }
    ```

    ```graphql
    # Billing subgraph
    type Bill @key(fields: "id") {
      id: ID!
      amount: Int!
    }
    ```

    </CodeColumns>

6. Deploy the updated Payments subgraph to your environment.

    * This resolves the composition error, because `Bill` now originates in a single subgraph. Apollo composes an updated supergraph schema, which your gateway automatically obtains when it polls the Apollo Uplink.

We're done! `Bill` now originates in a new subgraph, and it was resolvable during each step of the migration process.

</ExpansionPanel>

<ExpansionPanel title="With `IntrospectAndCompose`">

> ⚠️ We strongly recommend _against_ using `IntrospectAndCompose` in production. For details, see [Limitations of `IntrospectAndCompose`](./gateway/#limitations-of-introspectandcompose).

When you provide `IntrospectAndCompose` to `ApolloGateway`, it performs composition _itself_ on startup after fetching all of your subgraph schemas. If this runtime composition fails, the gateway fails to start up, resulting in downtime.

To minimize downtime for your graph, you need to make sure all of your subgraph schemas successfully compose whenever your gateway starts up. When migrating an entity, this requires a **coordinated deployment** of your modified subgraphs and a restart of the gateway itself.

1. In the Billing subgraph's schema, define the `Bill` entity just as it's defined in the Payments subgraph (do _not_ extend it):

    <CodeColumns>

    ```graphql
    # Payments subgraph
    type Bill @key(fields: "id") {
      id: ID!
      amount: Int!
    }

    type Payment {
      # ...
    }
    ```

    ```graphql {2-5}
    # Billing subgraph
    type Bill @key(fields: "id") {
      id: ID!
      amount: Int!
    }
    ```

    </CodeColumns>

2. In the Billing subgraph, define resolvers for each field of `Bill` that currently originates in the Payments subgraph. This subgraph should resolve those fields with the exact same logic as the resolvers in the Payments subgraph.

3. In the Payments subgraph's schema, remove the `Bill` entity and its associated resolvers:

    <CodeColumns>

    ```graphql
    # Payments subgraph
    type Payment {
      # ...
    }
    ```

    ```graphql
    # Billing subgraph
    type Bill @key(fields: "id") {
      id: ID!
      amount: Int!
    }
    ```

    </CodeColumns>

4. Bring down all instances of your gateway in your deployed environment. This downtime prevents inconsistent behavior during a rolling deploy of your subgraphs.

5. Deploy the updated Payments _and_ Billing subgraphs to your environment. When these deployments complete, bring your gateway instances back up and confirm that they start up successfully.

</ExpansionPanel>


### Field migration

The steps for migrating an individual field are nearly identical in form to the steps for [migrating an entire entity](#entity-migration).

Let's say our Products subgraph defines a `Product` entity, which includes the boolean field `inStock`:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Products subgraph
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  inStock: Boolean!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Then, we add an Inventory subgraph to our federated graph. It now makes sense for the `inStock` field to originate in the Inventory subgraph instead, like this:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Products subgraph
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
}
```

```graphql
# Inventory subgraph
extend type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
  inStock: Boolean!
}
```

</CodeColumns>


We can perform this migration with the following steps (additional commentary on each step is provided in [Entity migration](#entity-migration)):

1. In the Inventory subgraph's schema, [extend](#extending-entities) the `Product` entity to add the `inStock` field:

    <CodeColumns>

    ```graphql
    # Products subgraph
    type Product @key(fields: "id") {
      id: ID!
      inStock: Boolean!
    }
    ```

    ```graphql
    # Inventory subgraph
    extend type Product @key(fields: "id") {
      id: ID! @external
      inStock: Boolean!
    }
    ```

    </CodeColumns>

    * If you're using managed federation, register this schema change with Apollo.

2. In the Inventory subgraph, add a resolver for the `inStock` field. This subgraph should resolve the field with the exact same logic as the resolver in the Products subgraph.

3. Deploy the updated Inventory subgraph to your environment.

4. In the Products subgraph's schema, remove the `inStock` field and its associated resolver:

    <CodeColumns>

    ```graphql
    # Products subgraph
    type Product @key(fields: "id") {
      id: ID!
    }
    ```

    ```graphql
    # Inventory subgraph
    extend type Product @key(fields: "id") {
      id: ID! @external
      inStock: Boolean!
    }
    ```

    </CodeColumns>

    * If you're using managed federation, register this schema change with Studio.

5. **If you're using Rover composition,** compose a new supergraph schema. Deploy a new version of your gateway that uses the updated schema.

    * Skip this step if you're using managed federation.

5. Deploy the updated Products subgraph to your environment.

## Extending an entity with computed fields (advanced)

When you [extend an entity](#extending-entities), you can define fields that depend on fields in the entity's originating subgraph. For example, a `shipping` subgraph might extend the `Product` entity with a `shippingEstimate` field, which is calculated based on the product's `size` and `weight`:

```graphql {5} title="shipping"
extend type Product @key(fields: "sku") {
  sku: ID! @external
  size: Int @external
  weight: Int @external
  shippingEstimate: String @requires(fields: "size weight")
}
```

As shown, you use the `@requires` directive to indicate which fields (and subfields) from the entity's originating subgraph are required.

>You **cannot** require fields that are defined in a subgraph besides the entity's originating subgraph.

In the above example, if a client requests a product's `shippingEstimate`, the gateway will first obtain the product's `size` and `weight` from the `products` subgraph, then pass those values to the `shipping` subgraph. This enables you to access those values directly from your resolver:

```js {4}
{
  Product: {
    shippingEstimate(product) {
      return computeShippingEstimate(product.sku, product.size, product.weight);
    }
  }
}
```

### Using `@requires` with object subfields

If a computed field `@requires` a field that returns an object type, you also specify which _subfields_ of that object are required. You list those subfields with the following syntax:

```graphql {4} title="shipping"
extend type Product @key(fields: "sku") {
  sku: ID! @external
  dimensions: ProductDimensions @external
  shippingEstimate: String @requires(fields: "dimensions { size weight }")
}
```

In this modification of the previous example, `size` and `weight` are now subfields of a `ProductDimensions` object. Note that the `ProductDimensions` object must be defined in both the entity's extending subgraph _and_ its originating subgraph, either as an entity or as a [value type](./value-types/).

## Resolving another subgraph's field (advanced)

Sometimes, multiple subgraphs are capable of resolving a particular field for an entity, because all of those subgraphs have access to a particular data store. For example, an `inventory` subgraph and a `products` subgraph might both have access to the database that stores all product-related data.

When you [extend an entity](#extending-entities) in this case, you can specify that the extending subgraph `@provides` the field, like so:

```graphql {2,8-9} title="inventory"
type InStockCount {
  product: Product! @provides(fields: "name price")
  quantity: Int!
}

extend type Product @key(fields: "sku") {
  sku: String! @external
  name: String @external
  price: Int @external
}
```

**This is a completely optional optimization.** When the gateway plans a query's execution, it looks at which fields are available from each subgraph. It can then attempt to optimize performance by executing the query across the fewest subgraphs needed to access all required fields.

Keep the following in mind when using the `@provides` directive:

* Each subgraph that `@provides` a field must also define a resolver for that field. **That resolver's behavior must match the behavior of the resolver in the field's originating subgraph.**
* When an entity's field can be fetched from multiple subgraphs, there is no guarantee as to _which_ subgraph will resolve that field for a particular query.
* If a subgraph `@provides` a field, it must still list that field as `@external`, because the field originates in another subgraph.
