This API reference documents the exports from the `@apollo/gateway` package.

## `class ApolloGateway`

The core class of Apollo Server's federated gateway implementation. For an
example of using `ApolloGateway`, see [The gateway](/gateway/).

### Methods

#### `constructor`

Returns an initialized `ApolloGateway` instance, which you can then pass as the `gateway` configuration option to the `ApolloServer` constructor, like so:

```javascript{2-6}
const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway: new ApolloGateway({
    serviceList: [
      // ...
    ]
  }),
});
```

Takes an `options` object as a parameter. Supported fields of this object are described below.

##### Examples

###### Providing a `serviceList` and headers to authorize introspection

```js
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  serviceList: [
    { name: 'products', url: 'https://products-service.dev/graphql' },
    { name: 'reviews', url: 'https://reviews-service.dev/graphql' }
  ],
  introspectionHeaders: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer abc123'
  }
});
```

###### Configuring the subgraph fetcher

If you provide a [`buildService` function](#the-buildservice-function) to the constructor of `ApolloGateway`, the function is called once for each of your graph's subgraphs. This function can return a `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` with a custom `fetcher`, which is then used for all communication with subgraphs:

```js
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  buildService({ url, name }) {
    return new (class extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
      fetcher = require('make-fetch-happen').defaults({
        onRetry() {
          console.log('We will retry!')
        },
      });
    })({
      url,
      name,
    });
  }
});
```

###### Configuring the managed federation fetcher

> This _only_ configures the fetcher that your gateway uses to fetch [managed federation](../managed-federation/overview/) configuration from Apollo.
>
> See also [Configuring the subgraph fetcher](#configuring-the-subgraph-fetcher).

```js
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  fetcher: require('make-fetch-happen').defaults({
    onRetry() {
      console.log('We will retry!')
    },
  }),
});
```

##### Options

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr class="required">
<td>

###### `supergraphSdl`

`String`
</td>
<td>

A [supergraph schema](../#federated-schemas) ([generated with the Rover CLI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/supergraphs/#composing-a-supergraph-schema)) that's composed from your subgraph schemas. The supergraph schema includes directives that specify routing information for each subgraph.

**If you are using managed federation,** do not provide this field.

**If you _aren't_ using managed federation,** either this field or `serviceList` is required. Do not provide both.


</td>
</tr>


<tr class="required">
<td>

###### `serviceList`

`Array<ServiceEndpointDefinition>`
</td>
<td>

**This option is discouraged in favor of [`supergraphSdl`](#supergraphsdl).**

An array of objects that each specify the `name` and `url` of one subgraph in your federated graph. On startup, the gateway uses this array to obtain your subgraph schemas via introspection and compose a supergraph schema. 

You can specify any string value for the `name` field, which is used for identifying the subgraph in log output and error messages, and for reporting metrics to Apollo Studio.

**If you are using managed federation,** do not provide this field.

**If you _aren't_ using managed federation,** either this field or `supergraphSdl` is required. Do not provide both.


</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `introspectionHeaders`

`Object | (service: ServiceEndpointDefinition) => Promise<Object> | Object`
</td>
<td>

An object, or an (optionally) async function returning an object, containing the names and values of HTTP headers that the gateway includes _only_ when making introspection requests to your subgraphs.

**If you are using managed federation,** do not provide this field.

**If you define a [`buildService`](#buildservice) function,** specify these headers in that function instead of providing this option. This ensures that your `buildService` function doesn't inadvertently overwrite the values of any headers you provide here.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `debug`

`Boolean`
</td>
<td>

If `true`, enables development mode helpers and logs messages of all severity levels (`debug` through `error`). If `false`, only `warn`- and `error`-level messages are logged.

The default value is `false`.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `logger`

[`Logger`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L166-L172)
</td>
<td>

An object to use for logging in place of `console`. If provided, this object must implement all methods of [the `Logger` interface](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L166-L172).

If you provide this value, the gateway automatically logs all messages of _all_ severity levels (`debug` through `error`), regardless of whether the `debug` option is set to `true`. It is the responsibility of the logger to determine how to handle logged messages of each level.

This logger is automatically added to the `GraphQLRequestContext` object that's passed to all Apollo Server [plugin functions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/plugins/).
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `fetcher`

`typeof fetch`
</td>
<td>

Specifies which [Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-api) implementation to use with [managed federation](../managed-federation/overview/) when fetching configuration from Apollo.

By default, the gateway uses the default configuration of [`make-fetch-happen`](https://npm.im/make-fetch-happen). You can specify another valid implementation (such as [`node-fetch`](https://npm.im/node-fetch)) by setting this field's value to `require('node-fetch')`.

As shown in the example above, you can also provide [`make-fetch-happen`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/make-fetch-happen#extra-options) to this option if you want to override the library's default configuration.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `serviceHealthCheck`

`Boolean`
</td>
<td>

If `true`, the gateway sends a small query (`{ __typename }`) to all subgraphs on gateway startup. It also does the same on each live schema update if you're using managed federation.

**On startup,** the gateway throws an error if any of these requests fail.

**On schema update,** the gateway does not roll over to the new schema or graph configuration if any of these requests fail. The gateway retries the requests at each polling interval until they succeed.

The default value is `false`.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `buildService`

`Function`
</td>
<td>

Define this function to customize your gateway's data transport to some or all of your subgraphs. This customization can include using a protocol besides HTTP. For details, see [The `buildService` function](#the-buildservice-function).
</td>
</tr>


</tbody>
</table>

##### The `buildService` function

If you provide this function, the gateway calls it once for each subgraph. The function must return an object that implements the [`GraphQLDataSource` interface](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/570f548b88/packages/apollo-gateway/src/datasources/types.ts), such as an instance of [RemoteGraphQLDataSource](#class-remotegraphqldatasource) or a subclass of it.

The example below demonstrates adding an `x-user-id` HTTP header to every request the gateway sends to a subgraph:

```js{9-11}
class AuthenticatedDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
  willSendRequest({ request, context }) {
    request.http.headers.set('x-user-id', context.userId);
  }
}

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  // ...other options...
  buildService({ name, url }) {
    return new AuthenticatedDataSource({ url });
  },
});
```

##### Experimental options

**These options are experimental.**  They might be removed or change at any time, even within a patch release.

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
<tr>
<td>

###### `experimental_approximateQueryPlanStoreMiB`

`number`
</td>
<td>

Sets the approximate size (in MiB) of the gateway's query plan store. This cache is used to save query plans for reuse on subsequent queries that resolve to a previously observed `queryHash` (the SHA-256 of the incoming operation).

The default value is `30`, which is usually sufficient unless the server processes a large number of unique operations.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### `serviceHealthCheck`

When called, the gateway sends a small query (`{ __typename }`) to each subgraph to verify that they're all responsive. This function `throw`s on failure and returns a `Promise` to be `await`ed.

##### Parameters

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
<tr>
<td>

###### `serviceMap`

`Object` (`DataSourceMap`)
</td>
<td>

If provided, the gateway sends health check requests to only the data sources included in the map.

By default, the gateway uses `this.serviceMap` (i.e., it sends health check requests to all known subgraphs).
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## `class RemoteGraphQLDataSource`

Represents a connection between your federated gateway and _one_ of your subgraphs.

You can customize this connection by extending this class and overriding its `willSendRequest` and/or `didReceiveResponse` methods:

* Override `willSendRequest` to modify your gateway's requests to the subgraph before they're sent.
* Override `didReceiveResponse` to modify the subgraph's responses before the gateway passes them along to the requesting client.

These methods are described in detail below.

### Methods

#### `constructor`

Returns an initialized `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` instance:

```javascript
const productsDataSource = new RemoteGraphQLDataSource({
  url: 'https://products-service.dev/graphql'
});
```

Takes an `options` object as a parameter. Supported fields of this object are described below.


##### Options

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
<tr class="required">
<td>

###### `url`

`String`
</td>
<td>

**Required.** The subgraph's URL for sending fetch requests via HTTP.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `apq`

`Boolean`
</td>
<td>

If `true`, the gateway attempts to use [automated persisted queries (APQ)](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/) when sending queries to this subgraph. APQ can dramatically reduce the size of most requests sent over the network, especially for more complex queries.

The subgraph must also enable support for APQ for the gateway to use this feature (Apollo Server enables APQ by default).
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### `willSendRequest`

Override this method in a subclass to modify each outgoing fetch request before it's sent to the subgraph:

```js
// Adds an `x-user-id` header to each outgoing fetch request
class AuthenticatedDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource({
  willSendRequest({ request, context }) {
    request.http.headers.set('x-user-id', context.userId);
  }
});
```

This method takes a `requestContext`  object that contains both the original unmodified `request` and the current `context`.


#### `didReceiveResponse`

Override this method in a subclass to customize the gateway's behavior after it completes a fetch to the subgraph, but _before_ it sends a response to the requesting client:

```javascript
class CookieDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
  didReceiveResponse({ response, request, context }) {
    const cookie = request.http.headers.get('Cookie');
    if (cookie) {
      context.responseCookies.push(cookie);
    }

    // Return the response, even when unchanged.
    return response;
  }
}
```

This method takes a `requestContext` object that contains:

* The subgraph's `response`
* The gateway's `request` to the subgraph
* The current operation's `context`

This enables you to modify any combination of the operation's `context` and the response of the fetch. 

The `http` property of the `request` and `response` objects contains additional HTTP-specific properties, such as `headers`.

This method must return an object that matches the structure of a [`GraphQLResponse`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/2562d096/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L43-L48).  If no modifications are necessary, return the original `response`.

#### `didEncounterError`

Override this method in a subclass to customize the gateway's behavior after it encounters an error while communicating with the implementing service or while parsing its response (e.g., if the response is not well-formed JSON).

If you _don't_ override this method, the default implementation `throw`s the error, like so:

```javascript
class MyDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {

  didEncounterError(error, fetchRequest, fetchResponse, context) {
    throw error;
  }

}
```

Note that if you _don't_ `throw error` (or a different `Error`) in this method, `error` is thrown immediately after this method returns.

This method takes the following positional parameters:
