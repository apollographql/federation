This API reference documents the exports from the `@apollo/subgraph` package.

## `buildSubgraphSchema`

> This method was renamed from `buildFederatedSchema` after `@apollo/federation` v0.28.0 (the previous name still works, but it might be removed in a future release).

A function that takes a schema module object (or an array of them) and returns a federation-ready subgraph schema:

```js {2}
const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema: buildSubgraphSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers })
});
```

Used when [defining a subgraph](../subgraphs/#defining-a-subgraph) in a federated graph.

Each schema module is an object with the following format:

```js
{
  typeDefs: DocumentNode,
  resolvers: ResolverMap
}
```

### Parameters

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
<tr class="required">
<td>

###### `modules`

`Object` or `Array`
</td>
<td>

**Required.** A schema module object (or an array of them) with the structure shown above.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


### Example

```js
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me() {
      return { id: "1", username: "@ava" }
    }
  },
  User: {
    __resolveReference(user, { fetchUserById }){
      return fetchUserById(user.id)
    }
  }
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema: buildSubgraphSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers })
});
```

## `__resolveReference`

The name of a special **reference resolver** function you can define for every [entity](../entities/) in a subgraph schema's resolver map.

The `__resolveReference` function enables your gateway's query planner to resolve a particular entity by whatever unique identifier your other subgraphs use to reference it. For details, see [Defining an entity](../entities/#defining-an-entity).

The function takes the parameters listed below.

### Parameters

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

###### `reference`

`Object`
</td>
<td>

The representation of the entity that's passed from another subgraph.

This object includes a `__typename` field, along with whichever fields the subgraph uses for the entity's `@key`.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `context`

`Object`
</td>
<td>

An object that's passed to every resolver that executes for a particular operation. This enables resolvers to share helpful context, including any relevant `DataSource`s.

For details, see [The `context` argument](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/resolvers/#the-context-argument).
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `info`

`Object`
</td>
<td>

Contains information about the operation's execution state, including the field name, the path to the field from the root, and more.

This object's core fields are listed in the [GraphQL.js source code](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/type/definition.js#L954-L965), and it is extended with additional functionality by other modules, like [`apollo-cache-control`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/570f548b887/packages/apollo-cache-control).
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Example

```js
const typeDefs = gql`
  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  User: {
    __resolveReference(user, { datasources }){
      // user will always have at least the `id` and the `__typename` here
      return datasources.users.fetchUserById(user.id)
    }
  }
};
```
