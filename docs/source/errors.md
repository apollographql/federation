When Apollo Gateway attempts to **compose** the schemas provided by your [subgraphs](./building-supergraphs/subgraphs-overview/) into a **supergraph schema**, it confirms that:

* The subgraphs are valid
* The resulting supergraph schema is valid
* The gateway has all of the information it needs to execute operations against the resulting schema

If Apollo Gateway encounters an error, composition fails. This document lists subgraph validation and composition error codes, along with their root causes.


## Errors

The following errors might be raised during composition:

<div class="sticky-table">

| Code | Description | Since | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DEFAULT_VALUE_USES_INACCESSIBLE` | An element is marked as @inaccessible but is used in the default value of an element visible in the API schema. | 2.0.0 |  |
| `DIRECTIVE_COMPOSITION_ERROR` | Error when composing custom directives. | 2.1.0 |  |
| `DIRECTIVE_DEFINITION_INVALID` | A built-in or federation directive has an invalid definition in the schema. | 2.0.0 | Replaces: `TAG_DEFINITION_INVALID` |

| `EMPTY_MERGED_ENUM_TYPE` | An enum type has no value common to all the subgraphs that define the type. Merging that type would result in an invalid empty enum type. | 2.0.0 |  |

## Removed codes

The following error codes have been removed and are no longer generated by the most recent version of the `@apollo/gateway` library:

<div class="sticky-table">

| Removed Code | Comment |
|---|---|
| `DUPLICATE_ENUM_DEFINITION` | As duplicate enum definitions is invalid GraphQL, this will now be an error with code `INVALID_GRAPHQL`. |
| `DUPLICATE_ENUM_VALUE` | As duplicate enum values is invalid GraphQL, this will now be an error with code `INVALID_GRAPHQL`. |
| `DUPLICATE_SCALAR_DEFINITION` | As duplicate scalar definitions is invalid GraphQL, this will now be an error with code `INVALID_GRAPHQL`. |
| `ENUM_MISMATCH` | Subgraph definitions for an enum are now merged by composition. |
| `EXTERNAL_USED_ON_BASE` | As there is not type ownership anymore, there is also no particular limitation as to where a field can be external. |
| `INTERFACE_FIELD_IMPLEM_TYPE_MISMATCH` | This error was thrown by a validation introduced to avoid running into a known runtime bug. Since federation 2.3, the underlying runtime bug has been addressed and the validation/limitation was no longer necessary and has been removed. |
| `KEY_FIELDS_MISSING_EXTERNAL` | Using `@external` for key fields is now discouraged, unless the field is truly meant to be external. |
| `KEY_FIELDS_MISSING_ON_BASE` | Keys can now use any field from any other subgraph. |
| `KEY_MISSING_ON_BASE` | Each subgraph is now free to declare a key only if it needs it. |
| `KEY_NOT_SPECIFIED` | Each subgraph can declare key independently of any other subgraph. |
| `MULTIPLE_KEYS_ON_EXTENSION` | Every subgraph can have multiple keys, as necessary. |
| `NON_REPEATABLE_DIRECTIVE_ARGUMENTS_MISMATCH` | Since federation 2.1.0, the case this error used to cover is now a warning (with code `INCONSISTENT_NON_REPEATABLE_DIRECTIVE_ARGUMENTS`) instead of an error. |
| `PROVIDES_FIELDS_SELECT_INVALID_TYPE` | @provides can now be used on field of interface, union and list types. |
| `PROVIDES_NOT_ON_ENTITY` | @provides can now be used on any type. |
| `REQUIRES_FIELDS_HAS_ARGS` | Since federation 2.1.1, using fields with arguments in a @requires is fully supported. |
| `REQUIRES_FIELDS_MISSING_ON_BASE` | Fields in @requires can now be from any subgraph. |
| `REQUIRES_USED_ON_BASE` | As there is not type ownership anymore, there is also no particular limitation as to which subgraph can use a @requires. |
| `RESERVED_FIELD_USED` | This error was previously not correctly enforced: the _service and _entities, if present, were overridden; this is still the case. |
| `VALUE_TYPE_NO_ENTITY` | There is no strong different between entity and value types in the model (they are just usage pattern) and a type can have keys in one subgraph but not another. |
| `VALUE_TYPE_UNION_TYPES_MISMATCH` | Subgraph definitions for an union are now merged by composition. |
