### Subgraph changes

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Topic</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

Entities

</td>
<td>

* Entities no longer _originate_ in a subgraph. Instead, any number of subgraphs can define the same entity and _contribute fields_ to it.
* Multiple subgraphs _can_ contribute the same field to an entity, _if_ that field is marked as `@shareable` in every subgraph that defines it.
* Subgraphs no longer need to `extend` (or `@extends`) an entity whenever another subgraph already defines that entity.
* Each subgraph can apply any number of `@key` directives to an entity.
* Subgraphs _must_ no longer apply the `@external` directive to their `@key` fields.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

Value types

</td>
<td>

* To define a value type with shared fields across multiple subgraphs, those shared fields must be marked as `@shareable` in every subgraph that defines them.
* Value type fields _can_ differ across subgraphs (in certain ways). For details, see [Differing shared fields](./federated-types/sharing-types#differing-shared-fields).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

`Query` and `Mutation`

</td>
<td>

* More than one subgraph _can_ define the same field of the `Query` or `Mutation` type, _if_ that field is marked as `@shareable` in every subgraph that defines it.
* Subgraphs no longer need to apply the `extend` keyword (or the `@extends` directive) to the `Query` and `Mutation` types.

      <th>Topic</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

Entities

</td>
<td>

* Each entity _originates_ in exactly one subgraph and can be _extended_ in other subgraphs.
* An entity's originating subgraph _must_ apply _at least one_ `@key` directive to the entity definition.
* An extending subgraph must use the `extend` keyword (or the `@extends` directive) when defining another subgraph's entity.
* An extending subgraph must apply exactly one `@key` directive to any entity it extends. The `fields` of that `@key` must match a `@key` that's defined by the entity's originating subgraph.
* An extending subgraph must apply the `@external` directive to all `@key` fields of an entity it extends.
* If an entity field is defined in more than one subgraph, it must be marked as `@external` in all but _one_ subgraph.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

Value types

</td>
<td>

* Each subgraph that defines a value type _must_ define that value type _identically_.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

`Query` and `Mutation`

</td>
<td>

* More than one subgraph _cannot_ define the same field of the `Query` or `Mutation` type.
* Every subgraph must apply the `extend` keyword (or the `@extends` directive) to the `Query` and `Mutation` types.
