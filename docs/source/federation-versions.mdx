title: Federation version changelog
description: Understand changes between federation versions
---

This article describes notable changes and additions introduced in each minor version release of Apollo Federation. Most of these changes involve additions or modifications to [federation-specific directives](./federated-types/federated-directives/).

> For a _comprehensive_ changelog for Apollo Federation and its associated libraries, see [GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **To use a feature introduced in a particular federation version,** make sure your subgraph schema's `@link` directive targets that version (or higher):

    ```graphql
    extend schema
      @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.4", #highlight-line
            import: ["@key", "@shareable", "@interfaceObject"])
    ```

    The example above must target at least Federation v2.3, because the `@interfaceObject` directive was introduced in that version.

    > ⚠️ **Before you increment a subgraph's federation version, update your router and build pipeline!** For details, see [Updating your graph safely](/graphos/graphs/updating/).

- **If you maintain a [subgraph-compatible library](./building-supergraphs/supported-subgraphs/),** consult this article to stay current with recently added directives. All of these directive definitions are also listed in the [subgraph specification](./subgraph-spec/#subgraph-schema-additions).

## v2.3

<td>

##### `@interfaceObject`

</td>

Introduced. [Learn more.](./federated-types/interfaces)

```graphql
directive @interfaceObject on OBJECT
```

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `@key`

</td>
<td>

Can now be applied to interface definitions to support [entity interfaces](./federated-types/interfaces/).

(Previous versions of composition threw an error if `@key` was applied to an interface definition.)

## v2.2

**Directive changes**

      <th>Name</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

##### `@shareable`

</td>
<td>

Added `repeatable` to the directive definition.

```graphql
directive @shareable repeatable on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION
```

Additionally, composition now throws an error if `@shareable` is applied to fields of an `interface` definition.

```graphql

## v2.0

**Directive changes**

Subgraph schemas "opt in" to Federation 2 features by applying the `@link` directive to the `schema` type, like so:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0",
        import: ["@key", "@shareable"])
```

The `import` list of this definition must include each federation-specific directive that the subgraph schema uses. In the example above, the schema uses `@key` and `@shareable`.

For details on these directives as defined in Federation 2, see [Federation-specific GraphQL directives](./federated-types/federated-directives/).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

##### `@key`

</td>
<td>

Added optional `resolvable` argument.

```graphql
directive @key(
  fields: FieldSet!,
  resolvable: Boolean = true # highlight-line
) repeatable on OBJECT | INTERFACE
```

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `@shareable`

</td>

Introduced.

```graphql
directive @shareable on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION
```

Introduced.

```graphql
directive @inaccessible on
  | FIELD_DEFINITION
  | OBJECT
  | INTERFACE
  | UNION
  | ARGUMENT_DEFINITION
  | SCALAR
  | ENUM
  | ENUM_VALUE
  | INPUT_OBJECT

  url: String,
  as: String,

Entities

</td>
<td>

* Entities no longer _originate_ in a subgraph. Instead, any number of subgraphs can define the same entity and _contribute fields_ to it.
* Multiple subgraphs _can_ contribute the same field to an entity, _if_ that field is marked as `@shareable` in every subgraph that defines it.
* Subgraphs no longer need to `extend` (or `@extends`) an entity whenever another subgraph already defines that entity.
* Each subgraph can apply any number of `@key` directives to an entity.
* Subgraphs _must_ no longer apply the `@external` directive to their `@key` fields.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

Value types

</td>
<td>

* To define a value type with shared fields across multiple subgraphs, those shared fields must be marked as `@shareable` in every subgraph that defines them.
* Value type fields _can_ differ across subgraphs (in certain ways). For details, see [Differing shared fields](./federated-types/sharing-types#differing-shared-fields).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

`Query` and `Mutation`

</td>
<td>

* More than one subgraph _can_ define the same field of the `Query` or `Mutation` type, _if_ that field is marked as `@shareable` in every subgraph that defines it.
* Subgraphs no longer need to apply the `extend` keyword (or the `@extends` directive) to the `Query` and `Mutation` types.

Entities

</td>
<td>

* Each entity _originates_ in exactly one subgraph and can be _extended_ in other subgraphs.
* An entity's originating subgraph _must_ apply _at least one_ `@key` directive to the entity definition.
* An extending subgraph must use the `extend` keyword (or the `@extends` directive) when defining another subgraph's entity.
* An extending subgraph must apply exactly one `@key` directive to any entity it extends. The `fields` of that `@key` must match a `@key` that's defined by the entity's originating subgraph.
* An extending subgraph must apply the `@external` directive to all `@key` fields of an entity it extends.
* If an entity field is defined in more than one subgraph, it must be marked as `@external` in all but _one_ subgraph.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

Value types

</td>

* Each subgraph that defines a value type _must_ define that value type _identically_.

</td>

`Query` and `Mutation`

* More than one subgraph _cannot_ define the same field of the `Query` or `Mutation` type.
* Every subgraph must apply the `extend` keyword (or the `@extends` directive) to the `Query` and `Mutation` types.
