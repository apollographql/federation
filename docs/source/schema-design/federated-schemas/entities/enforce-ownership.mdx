In Federation 2, the notion of "extending" an entity type is strictly conceptual. All definitions of a type in different subgraphs are merged according to the "shareability" of fields. In the following example, neither subgraph really owns or extends the `Product` entity. Instead, they both contribute fields to it.

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="subgraph-a.graphql"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String
}
```

```graphql title="subgraph-b.graphql"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  reviews: [Review]
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Federation 1 required that one of these definitions used the `extend` keyword or `@extends` directive. Federation 2 drops this requirement to improve the flexibility of composition and reduce the possibility of hard composition errors.

However, in some situations you still might want to designate an "owner" of an entity and make "entity extension" a first-class concept in your supergraph.

One example is the ability assert which subgraph is responsible for documenting an entity. If two subgraphs add different descriptions to a type, composition selects one of those descriptions and emits a hint informing you of the inconsistency:

```
HINT: [INCONSISTENT_DESCRIPTION]: Element "Product" has inconsistent
descriptions across subgraphs. The supergraph will use description
(from subgraph "one"):
  """
  The Product type.
  """
In subgraph "two", the description is:
  """
  This is my description of the Product type.
  """
```

<Note>

When a description is inconsistent across subgraphs, composition selects the description from the first subgraph alphabetically by name.

</Note>

A mechanism for deciding the "owner" of the type allows tools such as linters to catch these inconsistencies early in the development process.

## Creating an `@owner` directive

You can add an `@owner` directive to your supergraph using the [`@composeDirective`](/graphos/reference/federation/directives#composedirective) functionality introduced in Federation 2.2.

```graphql title="subgraph-a.graphql"
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.3", import: ["@key", "@composeDirective"])
  @link(url: "https://graphql.mycompany.dev/owner/v1.0", import: ["@owner"])
  @composeDirective(name: "@owner")

directive @owner(team: String!) on OBJECT

type Product @key(fields: "id") @owner(team: "subgraph-a") {
  id: ID!
  name: String
}
```

The `@owner` directive now appears in the supergraph. Because we did not define the directive as `repeatable`, subgraphs cannot define it with different arguments.

## Writing a lint rule using the `@owner` directive

Here's an example of a [`@graphql-eslint`](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/eslint/docs) rule for subgraph schemas that uses the `@owner` directive to determine if a description is required:

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand">

```js
const { getDirective } = require("@graphql-tools/utils");
const { buildSchema } = require("graphql");

module.exports = {
  rules: {
    /** @type {import("@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin").GraphQLESLintRule} */
    "subgraph-owned-type-has-description": {
      create(context) {
        const schema = buildSchema(context.getSourceCode().text, {
          assumeValidSDL: true, // subgraph schemas may not be valid on their own
        });

        return {
          /**
           * For each object type defintion, look for an `@owner` directive.
           * If it exist, require a description.
           * If it doesn't, disallow a description.
           */
          ObjectTypeDefinition(node) {
            const type = schema.getType(node.name.value);
            const owner = getDirective(schema, type, "owner");

            if (owner && !node.description) {
              context.report({
                node,
                message: "Description is required on owned types",
              });
            }

            if (!owner && node.description) {
              context.report({
                node,
                message: "Description not allowed on unowned types",
              });
            }
          },
        };
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Using `@owner` to determine required approvers

Another use case for the `@owner` directive is to determine required reviewers when a schema change affects a type owned by another team.

The exact process depends on your source control and continuous integration systems. The following example steps assume you're using GitHub for both.

1. Add a `pull_request` workflow:

   ```yaml title=".github/workflows/add-reviewers.yaml"
   name: Add required reviewers for owned GraphQL types
   on: [pull_request]
   ```

2. Determine the affected types in the schema change:

   ```js
   import { diff } from "@graphql-inspector/core";
   import { buildSchema } from "graphql";

   const differences = diff(
     buildSchema(schemaFromBaseRef, { assumeValidSDL: false }),
     buildSchema(schemaFromCurrentRef, { assumeValidSDL: false })
   );

   /* Derive a list of affected types from the result:
   [
     {
       "criticality": {
         "level": "NON_BREAKING"
       },
       "type": "FIELD_ADDED",
       "message": "Field 'newField' was added to object type 'Product'",
       "path": "Product.newField"
     }
   ]
   */
   ```

3. Obtain the supergraph schema.

   You can use [`rover supergraph fetch`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/commands/supergraphs#supergraph-fetch) or retrieve it using the [Apollo Platform API](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/apollo-platform/explorer?explorerURLState=N4IgJg9gxgrgtgUwHYBcQC4QEcYIE4CeABAOIIoDKMADvgOZ4CG1AFgBQAkeCAZukQEkAIgEIAlEWAAdJESIA3RngCWjVG258iXXhOmy5RAPpGUBWkkaIZhogDoHRCLJJNWANSWrUkm7aIANowoCADOKACC1NR4EPIIYAAyjDBIUCy%2BBv5EAEYwygFgmdm23KEwASjFJbYmZhZWCH41cg52TrIAQvmFVFBQYaHVLYZQENwU6QhwjMMjo%2BMIQtDwyCjN8wC%2BGzXbWSV7uztEh4ane5sgm0A&variant=main).

4. Extract the owners for the affected types:

   ```js
   import { getDirective } from "@graphql-tools/utils";

   const supergraphSchema = buildSchema(supergraphSdl);
   const affectedTeams = [];

   for (const typeName of affectedTypes) {
     const type = supergraphSchema.getType(typeName);

     const owner = getDirective(schema, type, "owner")?.[0];

     if (owner) {
       affectedTeams.push(owner.team);
     }
   }
   ```

5. Add the team as reviewers on the pull request:

   ```js
   import { Octokit } from "@octokit/action";

   const octokit = new Octokit();

   const [owner, repo] = process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY.split("/");

   await octokit.pulls.requestReviewers({
     owner,
     repo,
     pull_number: pullNumber, // ${{ github.event.number }}
     team_reviewers: affectedTeams,
   });
   ```
