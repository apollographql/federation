subtitle: Understand changes between Apollo Federation versions
description: Understand changes between Apollo Federation major and minor versions.
---

This article describes notable changes and additions introduced in each minor version release of Apollo Federation. Most of these changes involve additions or modifications to [federation-specific directives](/graphos/reference/federation/directives/).

For a comprehensive changelog for Apollo Federation and its associated libraries, see [GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- To use a feature introduced in a particular federation version, make sure your subgraph schema's `@link` directive targets that version (or higher):

    ```graphql showLineNumbers=false disableCopy=true
    extend schema
      @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.3", #highlight-line
            import: ["@key", "@shareable", "@interfaceObject"])
    ```

    The example above must target at least Federation v2.3, because the `@interfaceObject` directive was introduced in that version.

    <Note>

    Before you increment a subgraph's federation version, update your router and build pipeline. For details, see [Updating your graph safely](/graphos/platform/graph-management/updates).

    </Note>

- If you maintain a [subgraph-compatible library](/graphos/reference/federation/compatible-subgraphs), consult this article to stay current with recently added directives. All of these directive definitions are also listed in the [subgraph specification](/graphos/reference/federation/subgraph-spec/#subgraph-schema-additions).

<hr/>

| First release | Available in GraphOS? | Minimum router version |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **April 2022** | **Yes** | **`1.0.0`** |

#### Directive changes

Subgraph schemas "opt in" to Federation 2 features by applying the `@link` directive to the `schema` type, like so:

```graphql showLineNumbers=false disableCopy=true
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0",
        import: ["@key", "@shareable"])
```

The `import` list of this definition must include each federation-specific directive that the subgraph schema uses. In the example above, the schema uses `@key` and `@shareable`.

For details on these directives as defined in Federation 2, see [Federation-specific GraphQL directives](/graphos/reference/federation/directives/).

##### `@key`

Added optional `resolvable` argument.

```graphql showLineNumbers=false disableCopy=true
directive @key(
  fields: FieldSet!,
  resolvable: Boolean = true # highlight-line
) repeatable on OBJECT | INTERFACE
```

##### `@shareable`

Introduced.

```graphql showLineNumbers=false disableCopy=true
directive @shareable on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION
```

##### `@inaccessible`

Introduced.

```graphql showLineNumbers=false disableCopy=true
directive @inaccessible on
  | FIELD_DEFINITION
  | OBJECT
  | INTERFACE
  | UNION
  | ARGUMENT_DEFINITION
  | SCALAR
  | ENUM
  | ENUM_VALUE
  | INPUT_OBJECT
  | INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION
```

##### `@override`

Introduced.

```graphql showLineNumbers=false disableCopy=true
directive @override(from: String!) on FIELD_DEFINITION
```

##### `@link`

Introduced.

```graphql showLineNumbers=false disableCopy=true
directive @link(
  url: String,
  as: String,
  for: link__Purpose,
  import: [link__Import]
) repeatable on SCHEMA
```

##### `@extends`, `@external`, `@provides`, `@requires`, `@tag`

No changes.

#### Subgraph changes

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

Entities

</td>
<td>

* Entities no longer originate in a subgraph. Instead, any number of subgraphs can define the same entity and contribute fields to it.
* Multiple subgraphs can contribute the same field to an entity, if that field is marked as `@shareable` in every subgraph that defines it.
* Subgraphs no longer need to `extend` (or `@extends`) an entity whenever another subgraph already defines that entity.
* Each subgraph can apply any number of `@key` directives to an entity.
* Subgraphs must no longer apply the `@external` directive to their `@key` fields.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

Value types

</td>
<td>

* To define a value type with shared fields across multiple subgraphs, those shared fields must be marked as `@shareable` in every subgraph that defines them.
* Value type fields can differ across subgraphs (in certain ways). For details, see [Differing shared fields](/graphos/schema-design/federated-schemas/sharing-types#differing-shared-fields).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

`Query` and `Mutation`

</td>
<td>

* More than one subgraph can define the same field of the `Query` or `Mutation` type, if that field is marked as `@shareable` in every subgraph that defines it.
* Subgraphs no longer need to apply the `extend` keyword (or the `@extends` directive) to the `Query` and `Mutation` types.

Entities

</td>
<td>

* Each entity originates in exactly one subgraph and can be extended in other subgraphs.
* An entity's originating subgraph must apply at least one `@key` directive to the entity definition.
* An extending subgraph must use the `extend` keyword (or the `@extends` directive) when defining another subgraph's entity.
* An extending subgraph must apply exactly one `@key` directive to any entity it extends. The `fields` of that `@key` must match a `@key` that's defined by the entity's originating subgraph.
* An extending subgraph must apply the `@external` directive to all `@key` fields of an entity it extends.
* If an entity field is defined in more than one subgraph, it must be marked as `@external` in all but one subgraph.

<td>

Value types

</td>
<td>

* Each subgraph that defines a value type must define that value type identically.

`Query` and `Mutation`
