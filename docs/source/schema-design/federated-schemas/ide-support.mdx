Many IDEs provide features to streamline federated GraphQL development, such as federation-aware syntax highlighting, inline performance information, and autocomplete for fields, types, and federation directives. Learn how to enable federation-specific features in tools like VS Code and JetBrains IDEs.

## Visual Studio Code

Apollo's [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.vscode-apollo) provides an all-in-one tooling experience for developing apps with Apollo. See the [dedicated documentation page](/vs-code-extension) for configuration details.

## JetBrains

Apollo's [JetBrains Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20645-apollo-graphql) provides federation-specific development features, such as autocomplete for federation directives. This plugin supports all IntelliJ-based IDEs, including:

- IntelliJ IDEA
- PyCharm
- PhpStorm
- WebStorm
- CLion
- RubyMine
- Rider
- GoLand

You must enable the Rover integration after installing the plugin. Otherwise, your IDE might display unexpected errors while you're working with a subgraph schema. See this [the dedicated documentation page](/graphos/schema-design/connectors/jetbrains#configuration) for configuration details.

## Additional resources

If your graph uses the Apollo Router Core or GraphOS Router, make sure to enable [router configuration awareness](/graphos/reference/router/configuration#configuration-awareness-in-your-text-editor) in your editor.

If you're developing with Apollo Connectors, refer to the connectors-specific [VS Code Extension](/graphos/schema-design/connectors/vs-code), [JetBrains IDEs](/graphos/schema-design/connectors/jetbrains), and [Vim/NeoVim](/graphos/schema-design/connectors/vim) pages.
