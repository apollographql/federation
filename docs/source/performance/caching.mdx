<Note>

Using cache control with Apollo Federation requires at least v3.0.2 of Apollo Server in your subgraphs and gateway. Apollo Server's cache hints API has evolved as of v3, so be sure to review the [updated caching documentation](/apollo-server/performance/caching/).

</Note>

## Using cache hints with subgraphs

To set [static cache hints](/apollo-server/performance/caching/#in-your-schema-static) with Apollo Server-based subgraphs, the `@cacheControl` directive and `CacheControlScope` enum definitions must be included in the subgraph schema:

```graphql
enum CacheControlScope {
  PUBLIC
  PRIVATE
}

directive @cacheControl(
  maxAge: Int
  scope: CacheControlScope
  inheritMaxAge: Boolean
) on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT | INTERFACE | UNION
```

The subgraph calculates and sets the cache hint for the response that it sends to the gateway, and the gateway then calculates the cache hint for the overall response. This hint is based on the most restrictive settings among all of the responses received from the subgraphs involved in query plan execution.

Cache hints can also be set [dynamically in subgraph resolvers](/apollo-server/performance/caching/#in-your-resolvers-dynamic).

### Setting entity cache hints

Subgraph schemas define an `_entities` root field on the `Query` type, so all query plans that require entity resolution have a [`maxAge` of `0` set by default](/apollo-server/performance/caching/#default-maxage). To override this default behavior, you can add a `@cacheControl` directive to an entity's definition:

```graphql
type Book @key(fields: "isbn") @cacheControl(maxAge: 30) {
  isbn: String!
  title: String
}
```

When the `_entities` field is resolved it checks the applicable concrete type for a cache hint (e.g. the `Book` type in the example above) and applies that hint instead.

To set cache hints dynamically, the [`cacheControl` object and its methods](/apollo-server/performance/caching/#in-your-resolvers-dynamic) are also available in the `info` parameter of the `__resolveReference` resolver.

### Overriding subgraph cache hints in the gateway

If a subgraph does not specify a `max-age`, the gateway will assume its response (and in turn, the overall response) cannot be cached. To override this behavior, you can set the `cache-control` header in the `didReceiveResponse` method of a `RemoteGraphQLDataSource`.

Additionally, if the gateway should ignore `cache-control` response headers from subgraphs that will affect the operation's cache policy, then you can set the `honorSubgraphCacheControlHeader` property of a `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` to `false` (this value is `true` by default).

The effect of setting `honorSubgraphCacheControlHeader` to `false` is to have no impact on the cacheability of the response in either direction. In other words, this property wonâ€™t determine whether the response can be cached, but it does exclude a subgraph's `cache-control` header from consideration in the gateway's calculation. If all subgraphs are excluded from consideration when calculating the overall `cache-control` header, the response sent to the client will not be cached.

There are detailed examples below that illustrate the resulting behavior when overriding this header for a subgraph.

## Example `maxAge` calculations

### Multi-subgraph entities

Consider the following subgraph schemas:

```graphql title="Astronauts Subgraph"
type Astronaut @key(fields: "id") @cacheControl(maxAge: 20) {
  id: ID!
  name: String
}

type Query {
  astronaut(id: ID!): Astronaut
  astronauts: [Astronaut]
}
```

```graphql title="Missions Subgraph"
type Mission {
  id: ID!
  crew: [Astronaut]
  designation: String!
  startDate: String
  endDate: String
}

type Astronaut @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  missions: [Mission]
}

type Query {
  mission(id: ID!): Mission @cacheControl(maxAge: 10)
  missions: [Mission]
}
```

For the following query:

```graphql
query GetMissionWithCrew {
  mission(id: 1) {
    designation
    crew {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The response will be considered not cacheable.

The `cache-control` header in the response from the astronauts subgraph will be `max-age=20, public` based on the cache hint applied to the `Astronaut` type, which will be taken into consideration when this subgraph responds to the `_entities` query from the gateway.

The missions subgraph, however, does not include a `cache-control` header in its response to the gateway, thus indicating that it is not cacheable. Consequently, the entire response sent to the client is not cacheable. At first glance, this behavior might seem unexpected because the `@cacheControl(maxAge: 10)` directive is applied to the `mission` root query field. But upon closer inspection, we see that this field returns the `Mission` type which contains a non-scalar `Astronaut` field and this type will have a [default `maxAge` of `0` applied](/apollo-server/performance/caching/#default-maxage).

The missions subgraph isn't aware of the cache hint set on the `Astronaut` type in the astronauts subgraph, so there are two ways to address this. The first option is to apply the `@cacheControl` directive to the `Astronaut` entity in the missions subgraph, with the `inheritMaxAge` argument set to `true`:

```graphql {3} title="Missions Subgraph"
type Mission {
  id: ID!
  crew: [Astronaut] @cacheControl(inheritMaxAge: true)
  designation: String!
  startDate: String
  endDate: String
}
```

Applying this argument will ensure that the `Astronaut` type inherits the `maxAge` set for its parent field (in this example, that's the `mission` field).

The second option is to set the `@cacheControl` directive for the `Astronaut` entity with the appropriate `maxAge` value instead:

```graphql {1} title="Missions Subgraph"
type Astronaut @key(fields: "id") @cacheControl(maxAge: 20) {
  id: ID!
  missions: [Mission]
}
```

Setting the `maxAge` property on the `Astronaut` type in the missions subgraph raises an important consideration about whether every subgraph should explicitly set these values for any entity types that they include. In most cases, it's likely preferable to apply `@cacheControl(inheritMaxAge: true)` wherever an entity type is used as a field's return type to avoid ambiguity. Depending on your requirements, you might want to disallow this entirely using custom linting for your subgraphs to ensure that multiple subgraphs do not set the `maxAge` or `scope` arguments when applying the `@cacheControl` directive.

### Gateway override

For these subgraph schemas:

```graphql title="Astronauts Subgraph"
type Astronaut @key(fields: "id") @cacheControl(maxAge: 20) {
  id: ID!
  name: String
}

type Query {
  astronaut(id: ID!): Astronaut
  astronauts: [Astronaut]
}
```

```graphql title="Missions Subgraph"
type Mission {
  id: ID!
  crew: [Astronaut] @cacheControl(inheritMaxAge: true)
  designation: String!
  startDate: String
  endDate: String
}

type Astronaut @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  missions: [Mission]
}

type Query {
  mission(id: ID!): Mission @cacheControl(maxAge: 10)
  missions: [Mission]
}
```

And this operation:

```graphql
query GetMissionWithCrew {
  mission(id: 1) {
    designation
    crew {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The response will have a `cache-control` header value of `max-age=10, public`, as expected.

However, if you wanted to disregard `cache-control` headers supplied by the missions subgraph, you could do so by setting `honorSubgraphCacheControlHeader` in the `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` options to `false` for that subgraph:

```javascript
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  // ...
  buildService({ name, url }) {
    return new RemoteGraphQLDataSource({
      url,
      honorSubgraphCacheControlHeader: name === "missions" ? false : true;
    });
  }
});
```

The response will now have a `cache-control` header value of `max-age=20, public` because only the cache hint from the astronauts subgraph will be considered in the gateway's calculation of the overall header.

Alternatively, we could instead override the `max-age=10, public` header from the missions subgraph response and set it to a completely different value as follows:

```javascript
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  // ...
  buildService({ name, url }) {
    return new RemoteGraphQLDataSource({
      url,
      didReceiveResponse({ response }) {
          if (name === "missions") {
            response.http.headers.set(
              "cache-control",
              "max-age=5, public"
            );
          }
          return response;
        }
    });
  }
});
```

The overall response will now have a `cache-control` header value of `max-age=5, public` because the missions subgraph's overridden header is more restrictive than the `max-age=20, public` header that was supplied by the astronauts subgraph.
