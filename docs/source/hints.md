When Apollo Gateway successfully **compose** the schemas provided by your [subgraphs](./subgraphs/) into a **supergraph schema**, it may generate a number of "hints" that bring special attention to parts of the composition that required a non-trivial resolution.
Those hints are mainly informative and usually does not indicate a problem, but are meant as a signal for your to double-check that the result of composition is indeed what was intended. 

This document lists the potential hints that can be generated and a description of why they are generated.


## Hints

The following hints may be generated by composition:

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| `FromSubgraphDoesNotExist` | Source subgraph specified by @override directive does not exist |
| `InconsistentArgumentPresence` | Indicates that an (optional) argument (of a field or directive definition) is not present in all subgraphs and will not be part of the supergraph. |
| `InconsistentArgumentType` | Indicates that an argument type (of a field/input field/directive definition) does not have the exact same types in all subgraphs, but that the types are "compatible" (2 types are compatible if one is a non-nullable version of the other, a list version, a subtype, or a combination of the former). |
| `InconsistentDefaultValuePresence` | Indicates that an argument definition (of a field/input field/directive definition) has a default value in only some of the subgraphs that define the argument. |
| `InconsistentDescription` | Indicates that an element has a description in more than one subgraph, and the descriptions are not equal. |
| `InconsistentEntity` | Indicates that an object is declared as an entity (has a `@key`) in only some of the subgraphs in which the object is defined. |
| `InconsistentEnumValueForInputEnum` | Indicates that a value of an enum type definition (that is only used as an Input type) has not been merged into the supergraph because it is defined in only a subset of the subgraphs that declare the enum |
| `InconsistentEnumValueForOutputEnum` | Indicates that a value of an enum type definition (that is only used as an Output type, or is unused) has been merged in the supergraph but is defined in only a subset of the subgraphs that declare the enum |
| `InconsistentExecutionDirectiveLocations` | Indicates that an execution directive definition is declared with inconsistent locations across subgraphs (and will use the intersection of all locations in the supergraph). |
| `InconsistentExecutionDirectivePresence` | Indicates that an execution directive definition is declared in only some of the subgraphs. |
| `InconsistentExecutionDirectiveRepeatable` | Indicates that an execution directive definition is marked repeatable in only a subset of the subgraphs (and will not be repeatable in the supergraph). |
| `InconsistentFieldType` | Indicates that a field does not have the exact same types in all subgraphs, but that the types are "compatible" (2 types are compatible if one is a non-nullable version of the other, a list version, a subtype, or a combination of the former). |
| `InconsistentInputObjectField` | Indicates that a field of an input object type definition is only defined in a subset of the subgraphs that declare the input object. |
| `InconsistentInterfaceValueTypeField` | Indicates that a field of an interface "value type" (has no  `@key` in any subgraph) is not defined in all the subgraphs that declare the type. |
| `InconsistentObjectValueTypeField` | Indicates that a field of an object "value type" (has no `@key` in any subgraph) is not defined in all the subgraphs that declare the type. |
| `InconsistentTypeSystemDirectiveLocations` | Indicates that a type system directive definition is declared with inconsistent locations across subgraphs (and will use the union of all locations in the supergraph). |
| `InconsistentTypeSystemDirectiveRepeatable` | Indicates that a type system directive definition is marked repeatable in only a subset of the subgraphs that declare the directive (and will be repeatable in the supergraph). |
| `InconsistentUnionMember` | Indicates that a member of a union type definition is only defined in a subset of the subgraphs that declare the union. |
| `NoExecutionDirectiveIntersection` | Indicates that, for an execution directive definition, no location for it appears in all subgraphs. |
| `OverriddenFieldCanBeRemoved` | Field has been overridden by another subgraph. Consider removing. |
| `OverrideDirectiveCanBeRemoved` | Field with @override directive no longer exists in source subgraph, the directive can be safely removed |
| `UnusedEnumType` | Indicates that an enum type is defined in some subgraphs but is unused (no field/argument references it) and will not be included in the supergraph |
