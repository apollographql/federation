This article describes how to set up Apollo Studio for a graph that uses Apollo Federation.

> As with all changes, you should first set up managed federation in a non-production environment, such as staging. To support this, you can use [variants](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/schema/registry/#managing-environments-with-variants), which are distinct versions of the same graph for different environments.

## 1. Get started

If you haven't yet, complete the first two steps from the Apollo Studio getting started guide:

1. [Create your account](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/getting-started/#1-create-your-account)
2. [Create your first graph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/getting-started/#2-create-your-first-graph)

> In the [Register your schema](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/getting-started/#3-register-your-schema) step, make sure you follow the instructions for a GraphQL server that uses Apollo Federation.

## 2. Register all subgraph schemas

<RegisterFederatedCli />

## 3. Modify the gateway (if necessary)

> This section assumes you are using Apollo Server with the `@apollo/gateway` library as your gateway.

If you've already set up Apollo Federation _without_ Apollo Studio, the constructor of your `ApolloGateway` instance probably includes a `supergraphSdl` option, like this:

```js {2}
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  supergraphSdl
});
```

This option is specific to _non_-managed federation, in which supergraph schema composition is performed via the Rover CLI.

With managed federation, composition is instead performed by _Apollo_, and the gateway regularly polls Apollo for an updated schema. This enables you to add, remove, and modify your subgraphs _without_ needing to restart your gateway.

Remove the `supergraphSdl` argument from your `ApolloGateway` constructor entirely:

```js
const gateway = new ApolloGateway();
```

## 4. Connect the gateway to Studio

Like your subgraphs, your gateway uses a graph API key to identify itself to Studio.

<ObtainGraphApiKey />

After obtaining your graph API key, you set two environment variables in your gateway's environment. If you're using a `.env` file with a library like [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), those environment variables look like this:

```sh title=".env"
APOLLO_KEY=<YOUR_GRAPH_API_KEY>
APOLLO_GRAPH_REF=<YOUR_GRAPH_ID>@<VARIANT>
```

You can also set this value directly in the command you use to start your gateway.

The `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` environment variable tells the gateway which variant of which graph to use (for example, `my-graph-id@production`). You can find your variant's graph ref at the very top of its README page in Studio.

> When running your gateway in an environment where outbound traffic to the internet is restricted, consult the [directions for configuring a proxy](/apollo-server/security/proxy-configuration) within Apollo Server.

## 5. Deploy the modified gateway

You can now deploy your modified gateway to begin fetching your federated schema from Studio instead of directly from your subgraphs.

On startup, your gateway will use its API key to fetch its federation config from Apollo. It can then begin executing operations across your subgraphs.
