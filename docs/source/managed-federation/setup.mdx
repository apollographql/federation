This article describes how to set up Apollo Studio for a data graph that uses Apollo Federation.

> As with all changes, you should first set up managed federation in a non-production environment, such as staging. To support this, you can use [variants](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/schema/registry/#managing-environments-with-variants), which are distinct versions of the same data graph for different environments.

## 1. Get started

If you haven't yet, complete the first two steps from the Apollo Studio getting started guide:

1. [Create your account](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/getting-started/#1-create-your-account)
2. [Create your first graph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/getting-started/#2-create-your-first-graph)

> In the [Register your schema](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/getting-started/#3-register-your-schema) step, make sure you follow the instructions for a GraphQL server that uses Apollo Federation.

## 2. Register all subgraph schemas

<RegisterFederatedCli />

## 3. Modify the gateway (if necessary)

> This section assumes you are using Apollo Server with the `@apollo/gateway` library as your gateway.

If you've already set up Apollo Federation _without_ Apollo Studio, the constructor of your `ApolloGateway` instance probably includes a `serviceList` option, like this:

```js
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  serviceList: [
    { name: 'Products', url: 'http://products-graphql.svc.cluster.local:4001/' },
    // Additional services defined here
  ],
});
```

This option specifies the name and URL for each of your graph's subgraphs. With managed federation, this information is no longer hardcoded in the gateway's constructor! Instead, the gateway regularly polls Apollo for this information. This enables you to add and remove subgraphs _without_ needing to restart your gateway.

Remove the `serviceList` argument from your `ApolloGateway` constructor entirely:

```js
const gateway = new ApolloGateway();
```

## 4. Connect the gateway to Studio

Like your subgraphs, your gateway uses an API key to identify itself to Studio.

<ObtainGraphApiKey />

After obtaining your graph API key, you set three environment variables in your gateway's environment. If you're using a `.env` file with a library like [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), those environment variables look like this:

```sh:title=.env
APOLLO_KEY=<YOUR_GRAPH_API_KEY>
APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT=https://uplink.api.apollographql.com/
APOLLO_GRAPH_REF=<YOUR_GRAPH_ID>@<VARIANT>
```

You can also set these values directly in the command you use to start your gateway.

The second environment variable, `APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT`, instructs the gateway to fetch its configuration from a new (and recommended) Apollo-hosted endpoint called the **uplink**. If you don't set this value, the gateway instead fetches its configuration from a file hosted in Google Cloud Storage.

The third environment variable, `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF`, tells the gateway which graph to use and with which variant. You would supply your graph id and the variant you want to use (for example, `current`). You can always find a a graph's ref at the top of its Schema Reference page in Studio.

> When running your gateway in an environment where outbound traffic to the internet is restricted, consult the [directions for configuring a proxy](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/proxy-configuration/) within Apollo Server.

## 5. Deploy the modified gateway

You can now deploy your modified gateway to begin fetching your federated schema from Studio instead of directly from your subgraphs.

On startup, your gateway will use its API key to fetch its federation config from Apollo. It can then begin executing operations across your subgraphs.
