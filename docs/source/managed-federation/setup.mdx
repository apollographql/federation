title: Setting up managed federation

import ObtainGraphApiKey from '../../shared/obtain-graph-api-key.mdx';

This article describes how to connect your supergraph to [Apollo GraphOS](/graphos/) to enable managed federation features.

> As with all changes, you should first set up managed federation in a non-production environment, such as staging. To support this, you can create multiple [variants](/graphos/graphs/#variants) of your supergraph in GraphOS Studio. Each variant represents a distinct version of the same graph for different environments.

## 1. Get started

First, complete the **Set up Apollo tools** step from [this tutorial](/graphos/quickstart/self-hosted#1-set-up-apollo-tools), including:

- Creating an Apollo account
- Creating a graph in Studio
- Installing and authenticating the Rover CLI

Then return here.

## 2. Publish all subgraph schemas

In a supergraph architecture, each of your [subgraphs](../building-supergraphs/subgraphs-overview/) uses the Rover CLI to publish its schema to GraphOS:

```mermaid
graph LR;
  subgraph " "
  router([Router]);
  subgraphA[Products subgraph];
  subgraphB[Reviews subgraph];
  subgraphC[Inventory subgraph];
  end
  registry{{GraphOS<br/>Schema Registry}};
  router --- subgraphA & subgraphB & subgraphC;
  subgraphA & subgraphB & subgraphC -.->|<code>rover subgraph publish</code>| registry;
  class registry secondary;
```

**Do the following for each of your subgraphs**:

1. Obtain the following values, which are required for the `rover subgraph publish` command:

    * The name that uniquely identifies the subgraph within your graph (e.g., `products`).
    * The URL that your router will use to communicate with the subgraph (e.g., `http://products-graphql.svc.cluster.local:4001/`).

2. Run the `rover subgraph publish` command, providing it your subgraph's schema in one of the ways shown:

    ```bash
    # Provide a local .graphql file path
    rover subgraph publish my-graph@my-variant --name products --routing-url http://products-graphql.svc.cluster.local:4001/ --schema ./schema.graphql 

    # Provide an introspection result via stdin
    rover subgraph introspect http://localhost:4000 | rover subgraph publish my-graph@my-variant --name products --routing-url http://products-graphql.svc.cluster.local:4001/ --schema -
    ```

As you register your subgraph schemas, the schema registry attempts to **compose** their latest versions into a single **supergraph schema**. Whenever composition succeeds, your managed router can fetch the latest supergraph schema from GraphOS.

You can also manually fetch your latest supergraph schema with the `rover supergraph fetch` command, or retrieve it from your graph's **Schema > SDL** tab in GraphOS Studio.

## 3. Modify your router's startup command

<ExpansionPanel title="Using Apollo Gateway?">

If you've already set up Apollo Federation _without_ conneting your gateway to GraphOS, the constructor of your `ApolloGateway` instance probably includes a `supergraphSdl` option, like this:

```js {2}
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  supergraphSdl
});
```

This option is specific to _non_-managed federation, in which supergraph schema composition is performed via the Rover CLI.

With managed federation, composition is instead performed by _GraphOS_, and the gateway regularly polls for an updated schema. This enables you to add, remove, and modify your subgraphs _without_ needing to restart your gateway.

Remove the `supergraphSdl` argument from your `ApolloGateway` constructor entirely:

```js
const gateway = new ApolloGateway();
```

> When running your gateway in an environment where outbound traffic to the internet is restricted, consult the [directions for configuring a proxy](/apollo-server/security/proxy-configuration) within Apollo Server.

</ExpansionPanel>

If you've already set up Apollo Federation _without_ connecting your router to GraphOS, you're probably passing the `--supergraph` (or `-s`) option to the Apollo Router's startup command:

```sh
./router --config ./router.yaml --supergraph ./your-local-supergraph.graphql
```

The `--supergraph` option is specific to _non_-managed federation, in which supergraph schema composition is performed via the Rover CLI and provided via a file path.

_Remove_ the `--supergraph` option (but leave `--config` if it's present):

```sh
./router --config ./router.yaml
```

> With managed federation, composition is instead performed by _GraphOS_, and the router regularly polls for an updated schema. This enables you to add, remove, and modify your subgraphs _without_ needing to restart your router.


## 4. Connect your router to GraphOS

Like your subgraphs, your router uses a graph API key to identify itself to GraphOS.

<ObtainGraphApiKey />

After obtaining your graph API key, you set the following environment variables in your router's environment:

- `APOLLO_KEY` (set this to your graph API key)
- `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF`
    - This variable tells the router which variant of which graph to use (for example, `docs-example-graph@production`). You can find your variant's graph ref at the very top of its README page in GraphOS Studio.

## 5. Deploy the modified router

You can now deploy your modified router to begin fetching your supergraph schema from GraphOS instead of using a locally generated one.

On startup, your router will use its API key to fetch its federation config from GraphOS. It can then begin executing operations across your subgraphs.
