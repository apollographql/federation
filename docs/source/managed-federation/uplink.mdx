When using [managed federation](./overview/), your federated gateway regularly polls an endpoint called **Apollo Uplink** for its latest supergraph schema and other configuration:

```mermaid
graph LR;
  subgraph "Your infrastructure"
  serviceA[Products subgraph];
  serviceB[Reviews subgraph];
  gateway([Gateway]);
  end
  subgraph "Apollo cloud"
  registry{{Apollo Schema Registry}};
  uplink{{Apollo Uplink}}
  end
  serviceA & serviceB -->|Pushes schema| registry;
  registry -->|Updates config| uplink;
  gateway -->|Polls for config changes| uplink;
  class registry secondary;
  class uplink secondary;
```

To maximize uptime, Uplink is hosted simultaneously at _two_ endpoints, one in GCP and one in AWS:

* GCP: `https://uplink.api.apollographql.com/`
* AWS: `https://aws.uplink.api.apollographql.com/`

By default in versions of `@apollo/gateway` v0.45.0 and later, your gateway polls the GCP URL at a regular interval. Whenever a poll request fails, the gateway retries that request with the AWS URL. It continues swapping between the two URLs until the request succeeds, or until reaching the maximum number of retries.

Even if a particular poll request fails _all_ of its retries, the gateway continues polling as usual at the next interval (with its own set of retries if needed). In the meantime, the gateway continues using its most recently obtained configuration.

> Versions of `@apollo/gateway` prior to v0.45.0 don't support multiple Uplink endpoints and only use the GCP URL by default.

## Configuring polling behavior

You can configure the number of retries your gateway performs for a failed poll request, along with the list of Uplink URLs your gateway uses.

### Retry limit

You can configure how many times your gateway retries a single failed poll request like so:

```js
const { ApolloGateway } = require('@apollo/gateway');

// ...

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  uplinkMaxRetries: 2
});
```

By default, the gateway retries a single poll request a number of times equal to three times the number of [Uplink URLs](#uplink-urls-advanced) (this is almost always `6` times).

> Even if a particular poll request fails _all_ of its retries, the gateway continues polling as usual at the next interval (with its own set of retries if needed). In the meantime, the gateway continues using its most recently obtained configuration.


### Uplink URLs (advanced)

> ⚠️ Most gateways never need to configure their list of Apollo Uplink URLs. Consult this section only if advised to do so.

You can provide a custom list of URLs for the gateway to use when polling Uplink. For example, you can prioritize the AWS URL or omit one of the URLs entirely.

You can provide this list either in the `ApolloGateway` constructor or as an environment variable.

#### `ApolloGateway` constructor

Provide a custom list of Uplink URLs to the `ApolloGateway` constructor like so:

```js
const { ApolloGateway } = require('@apollo/gateway');

// ...

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  uplinkEndpoints: [
    'https://aws.uplink.api.apollographql.com/',
    'https://uplink.api.apollographql.com/'
  ]
});
```

This example swaps the priority of the two Uplink URLs, which means the gateway polls the AWS URL first.

Note that if you _also_ provide a list of endpoints via [environment variable](#environment-variable), the environment variable takes precedence.

#### Environment variable

You can provide a comma-separated list of Uplink URLs as the value of the `APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT` environment variable in your gateway's environment:

```bash
APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT=https://aws.uplink.api.apollographql.com/,https://uplink.api.apollographql.com/
```

This example swaps the priority of the two Uplink URLs, which means the gateway polls the AWS URL first.
