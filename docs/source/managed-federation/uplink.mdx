title: Apollo Uplink
description: Fetch your managed gateway's configuration
---

When using [managed federation](./overview/), your federated gateway regularly polls an endpoint called **Apollo Uplink** for its latest supergraph schema and other configuration:

```mermaid
graph LR;
  subgraph "Your infrastructure"
  serviceA[Products subgraph];
  serviceB[Reviews subgraph];
  gateway([Gateway]);
  end
  subgraph "Apollo cloud"
  registry{{Apollo Schema Registry}};
  uplink{{Apollo Uplink}}
  end
  serviceA & serviceB -->|Pushes schema| registry;
  registry -->|Updates config| uplink;
  gateway -->|Polls for config changes| uplink;
  class registry secondary;
  class uplink secondary;
```

To maximize uptime, Uplink is hosted simultaneously at _two_ endpoints, one in GCP and one in AWS:

* GCP: `https://uplink.api.apollographql.com/`
* AWS: `https://aws.uplink.api.apollographql.com/`

By default in versions of `@apollo/gateway` v0.45.0 and later, your gateway polls Uplink every ten seconds. Every time it does so, it cycles between Uplink endpoints in round-robin fashion.

Whenever a poll request fails, the gateway retries that request (again, using round robin). It continues retrying until a request succeeds, or until reaching the defined maximum number of retries.

Even if a particular poll request fails _all_ of its retries, the gateway continues polling as usual at the next interval (with its own set of retries if needed). In the meantime, the gateway continues using its most recent successfully obtained configuration.

> Versions of `@apollo/gateway` prior to v0.45.0 don't support multiple Uplink endpoints and only use the GCP endpoint by default.

## Configuring polling behavior

You can configure the following aspects of your gateway's polling behavior:

* The number of retries your gateway performs for a failed poll request
* The interval at which your gateway polls
* The list of Uplink URLs your gateway uses

### Retry limit

You can configure how many times your gateway retries a single failed poll request like so:

```js {6}
const { ApolloGateway } = require('@apollo/gateway');

// ...

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  uplinkMaxRetries: 2
});
```

By default, the gateway retries a single poll request a number of times equal to three times the number of [Uplink URLs](#uplink-urls-advanced) (this is almost always `6` times).

> Even if a particular poll request fails _all_ of its retries, the gateway continues polling as usual at the next interval (with its own set of retries if needed). In the meantime, the gateway continues using its most recently obtained configuration.

### Poll interval

You can configure the interval at which your gateway polls Apollo Uplink like so:

```js {6}
const { ApolloGateway } = require('@apollo/gateway');

// ...

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  pollIntervalInMs: 15000 // 15 seconds
});
```

The `pollIntervalInMs` option specifies the polling interval in milliseconds. This value must be at least `10000` (which is also the default value).

### Uplink URLs (advanced)

> ⚠️ Most gateways never need to configure their list of Apollo Uplink URLs. Consult this section only if advised to do so.

You can provide a custom list of URLs for the gateway to use when polling Uplink. You can provide this list either in the `ApolloGateway` constructor or as an environment variable.

#### `ApolloGateway` constructor

Provide a custom list of Uplink URLs to the `ApolloGateway` constructor like so:

```js {6-9}
const { ApolloGateway } = require('@apollo/gateway');

// ...

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  uplinkEndpoints: [
    // Omits AWS endpoint
    'https://uplink.api.apollographql.com/'
  ]
});
```

This example omits the AWS endpoint, which means it's never polled.

Note that if you _also_ provide a list of endpoints via [environment variable](#environment-variable), the environment variable takes precedence.

#### Environment variable

You can provide a comma-separated list of Uplink URLs as the value of the `APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT` environment variable in your gateway's environment:

```bash
APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT=https://aws.uplink.api.apollographql.com/,https://uplink.api.apollographql.com/
```

## Schema size limit

Supergraph schemas provided by Uplink cannot exceed 6MB in size. The _vast_ majority of supergraph schemas are well below this limit.

If your supergraph schema _does_ exceed 6MB, you can set up a [build status webhook](/studio/build-status-notification/) for your graph. Whenever you're notified of a successful supergraph schema composition, your webhook can fetch the latest supergraph schema via the Rover CLI.
