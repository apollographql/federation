[Apollo GraphOS](/graphos/) provides managed federation support for graphs that use Apollo Federation.

With managed federation, you maintain subgraphs and delegate GraphOS to manage CI/CD tasks including the validation, composition, and update of your supergraph:

* Your subgraphs publish their schemas to GraphOS, which stores them in its schema registry. GraphOS then [validates](./federated-schema-checks) and [composes](../federated-types/composition/) them into a supergraph schema. 

* Your routers can poll GraphOS&mdash;specifically, its [Apollo Uplink](./uplink) endpoint&mdash;to get the latest validated supergraph schema and other configurations.

## Benefits of managed federation

Managed federation helps your organization safely validate, coordinate, deploy, and monitor changes to your graph. It provides:

### Router stability

You can modify subgraph schemas (and even add or remove entire subgraphs) without needing to modify or redeploy your router. Your router is the point of entry to your entire graph, and it should maximize its uptime.

### Composition stability

Whenever your router obtains an updated configuration from Apollo, it knows that the updated set of subgraph schemas will compose, because the configuration includes the composed supergraph schema.

The router also knows that your subgraphs are prepared to handle operations against the updated set of schemas. This is because your subgraphs should publish their updated schemas as part of their deployment, meaning they're definitely running by the time the router is aware of the configuration change.

And whenever a subgraph accidentally pushes a schema change that doesn't compose, GraphOS continues to provide the most recent valid configuration to your router.

### Schema flexibility

By using a configuration manager that's external to your router, you help ensure the safety of certain schema changes. For example, if you want to migrate a type or field from one subgraph's schema to another, you can perform this migration safely only if you externalize your configuration.
