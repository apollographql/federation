title: Managed federation overview
---

Apollo provides free **managed federation** support for graphs that use Apollo Federation.

With managed federation, your subgraphs each publish their schemas to the Apollo, which verifies that they successfully [compose](../federated-types/composition/) into a federated schema.

On composition success, Studio updates your graph's latest configuration, which is available at a special endpoint (called the **uplink**) that your gateway regularly polls for updates:

```mermaid
graph LR;
  subgraph "Your infrastructure"
  serviceA[Products<br/>subgraph];
  serviceB[Reviews<br/>subgraph];
  gateway([Gateway]);
  end
  subgraph "Apollo cloud"
    registry{{Apollo Schema<br/>Registry}};
    uplink{{Apollo<br/>Uplink}}
  end
  serviceA & serviceB -->|Publishes schema| registry;
  registry -->|Updates config| uplink;
  gateway -->|Polls for config changes| uplink;
  class registry secondary;
  class uplink secondary;
```

## Benefits of managed federation

Managed federation helps your organization safely validate, coordinate, deploy, and monitor changes to your graph. It provides:

### Gateway stability

You can modify subgraph schemas (and even add or remove entire subgraphs) _without_ needing to modify or redeploy your gateway. Your gateway is the point of entry to your entire graph, and it should maximize its uptime.

### Composition stability

Whenever your gateway obtains an updated configuration from Apollo, it knows that the updated set of subgraph schemas will compose, because the configuration includes the composed supergraph schema.

The gateway _also_ knows that your subgraphs are prepared to handle operations against the updated set of schemas. This is because your subgraphs should register their updated schemas as part of their deployment, meaning they're definitely running by the time the gateway is aware of the configuration change.

And whenever a subgraph accidentally pushes a schema change that _doesn't_ compose, Apollo continues to provide the most recent _valid_ configuration to your gateway.


### Schema flexibility

By using a configuration manager that's external to your gateway, you help ensure the safety of certain schema changes. For example, if you want to migrate a type or field from one subgraph's schema to another, you can perform this migration safely _only_ if you externalize your configuration.

## Manual composition

**Managed federation is strongly recommended for all production environments.** For non-production environments (such as local development), it can be helpful instead to [manually compose the supergraph schema](/technotes/TN0006-unmanaged-federation/).
