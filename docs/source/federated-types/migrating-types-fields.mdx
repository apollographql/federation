> ⚠️ **These methods are under consideration for Federation 2.** For current migration guidance, see [Migrating entities and fields](../entities/#migrating-entities-and-fields-advanced).

Your federated graph constantly grows and changes alongside your organization. Often, this requires moving existing functionality between subgraphs. Federation 2 helps you do this safely.

## Migrating entity fields

Let's say our federated graph includes a **Products** subgraph with a `Product` [entity](../entities/):

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Products subgraph
type Product @entity @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  inStock: Boolean!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Now, let's say we want to add a new **Inventory** subgraph to our graph. The Inventory subgraph will track product availability, so it makes sense for us to resolve the `inStock` field there instead.

This is how we want things to look when we're done:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Products subgraph
type Product @entity @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

```graphql
# Inventory subgraph
type Product @entity {
  id: ID!
  inStock: Boolean!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Let's look at how we can achieve this migration while making sure our graph can resolve `Product.inStock` throughout the process.

### 1. Add the `@shared` directive

By default, each field of an entity can be defined by _exactly one subgraph_. But during this migration, we'll temporarily want both Products _and_ Inventory to define `inStock`.

We accomplish this by adding the `@shared` directive to `Product.inStock`:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{5}
# Products subgraph
type Product @entity @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  inStock: Boolean! @shared
}
```

</CodeColumns>

> ⚠️ Make sure to compose your supergraph schema and deploy the changes in each step before proceeding to the _next_ step.

### 2. Define and resolve the field in the new subgraph

Thanks to the `@shared` directive, we'll no longer [break composition](./composition/#breaking-composition) if we also define `inStock` in the Inventory subgraph. We can deploy Inventory with the following definition:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Products subgraph
type Product @entity @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  inStock: Boolean! @shared
}
```

```graphql{2-5}
# Inventory subgraph
type Product @entity {
  id: ID!
  inStock: Boolean! @shared
}
```

</CodeColumns>

> ⚠️ Make sure the Inventory subgraph can resolve these fields, _and_ that it resolves them with the _same logic_ as the Products subgraph.

After we compose and deploy this change, our gateway might resolve `Product.inStock` in the Products subgraph _or_ in the Inventory subgraph, depending on the details of a particular operation.

### 3. Remove the field from the original subgraph

Now that the Inventory subgraph is resolving `inStock`, we can remove the field (and its resolver) from the Products subgraph:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{5}
# Products subgraph
type Product @entity @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  # inStock field removed
}
```

```graphql
# Inventory subgraph
type Product @entity {
  id: ID!
  inStock: Boolean! @shared
}
```

</CodeColumns>

After we compose and deploy _this_ change, the Inventory subgraph is solely responsible for resolving `inStock`.

### 4. Remove the `@shared` directive

If we want to make sure that the Inventory subgraph is the _only_ subgraph that can resolve `inStock`, we now remove the `@shared` directive from it:


<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Products subgraph
type Product @entity @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

```graphql{4}
# Inventory subgraph
type Product @entity {
  id: ID!
  inStock: Boolean!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

And there we have it! We've moved `Product.inStock` over to the Inventory subgraph, and at each stage of the process, our federated graph was always able to resolve `inStock`.

## Migrating `Query` and `Mutation` fields

The fields of the `Query` and `Mutation` types are **entry points** into your federated graph. Usually, migrating one of these fields involves simultaneously migrating whatever _other_ fields the entry point provides access to.

On its own, migrating a field of `Query` or `Mutation` is almost identical to [migrating an entity field](#migrating-entity-fields).

Let's say we're starting with the following Products subgraph:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Products subgraph
type Query {
  products: [Product!]!
  inventoryCount(productId: ID!): Int!
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

Once again, we're adding an Inventory subgraph and we want to migrate the `Query.inventoryCount` field to it:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Products subgraph
type Query {
  products: [Product!]!
}
```

```graphql
# Inventory subgraph
type Query {
  inventoryCount(productId: ID!): Int!
}
```
</CodeColumns>

To achieve this migration, we'd follow the _same steps_ shown for [migrating an entity field](#migrating-entity-fields). However, we'd need to make sure we migrated all of the necessary _subfields_ at the same time.
