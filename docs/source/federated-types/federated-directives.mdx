title: Federation-specific GraphQL directives
---

Apollo Federation defines a collection of **directives** that you use in your subgraph schemas to enable certain features.

## Importing directives

To use federated directives in a Federation 2 subgraph schema, apply the `@link` directive with the following format to the `schema` type:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0",
        import: ["@key", "@shareable"])
```

You can apply this directive to your existing `schema` declaration if you have one, or to a new `extend schema` declaration (as shown above).

Modify the `import` array to include whichever federated directives your subgraph schema uses. The example above imports the [`@key`](#key) and [`@shareable`](#shareable) directives (which are used most commonly).

> Make sure to include the `@` in each directive name!

### Renaming directives

If a federated directive's name matches one of your own custom directives, you can rename the federated directive with the following syntax:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0",
        import: [{ name: "@key", as: "@primaryKey"}, "@shareable"])
```

This example subgraph schema uses `@primaryKey` for the federated directive usually named [`@key`](#key).

### `@link`

```graphql
directive @link(
  url: String!,
  as: String,
  for: link__Purpose,
  import: [link__Import]
) repeatable on SCHEMA
```

Links definitions from an external specification to this schema. Every Federation 2 subgraph uses the `@link` directive to import the _other_ federation-specific directives described in this article (see the syntax in [Importing directives](#importing-directives)).

For more information on `@link`, see the [official spec](https://specs.apollo.dev/link/v1.0/).

## Managing types

### `@key`

```graphql
directive @key(fields: FieldSet!, resolvable: Boolean = true) repeatable on OBJECT | INTERFACE
```

Designates an object type as an [entity](../entities/) and specifies its **key fields** (a set of fields that the subgraph can use to uniquely identify any instance of the entity).

```graphql {1}
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Int
}
```

You can apply multiple `@key` directives to a single entity (to specify multiple valid sets of key fields), _if_ your subgraph library supports repeatable directives:

```graphql {1}
type Product @key(fields: "upc") @key(fields: "sku") {
  upc: ID!
  sku: ID!
  name: String
}
```

To check whether your subgraph library supports repeatable directives, see the `@KEY (MULTI)` item in [Federation-compatible subgraph implementations](../supported-subgraphs/).

> Although it's valid to apply `@key` to an interface definition, this currently has no effect in Apollo Federation.

#### Arguments

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr class="required">
<td>

##### `fields`

</td>
<td>

**Required.** A GraphQL selection set (provided as a string) of fields and subfields that contribute to the entity's primary key.

Examples:

* `"id"`
* `"username region"`
* `"name organization { id }"`

See also [Advanced `@key`s](../entities-advanced/#advanced-keys).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `resolvable`

`Boolean`
</td>
<td>

If `false`, indicates to the graph router that this subgraph _doesn't_ define a [reference resolver](../entities/#2-define-a-reference-resolver) for this entity. This means that router query plans can't "jump to" this subgraph to resolve fields that aren't defined in _another_ subgraph.

Most commonly, you set this to `false` when [referencing an entity without contributing fields](../entities/#referencing-an-entity-without-contributing-fields).

The default value is `true`.

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

### `@extends`

```graphql
directive @extends on OBJECT | INTERFACE
```

Indicates that an object or interface definition is an extension of _another_ definition of that same type.

> ⚠️ **If you define your subgraph schema in a static text file, do not use this directive!** Instead, use GraphQL's built-in `extend` keyword.

This directive is for use with GraphQL subgraph libraries that generate their schema programmatically and do _not_ support the `extend` keyword. It provides an alternate mechanism for indicating type extensions.

> Note that Federation 2 does not require any use of type extensions.
>
> In Federation 1, every subgraph must extend the `Query` and `Mutation` types (if it defines them), and entities are extended in every subgraph that defines them _except_ their originating subgraph.

## Managing shared fields

### `@shareable`

```graphql
directive @shareable on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT
```

Indicates that an object type's field is allowed to be resolved by multiple subgraphs (by default in Federation 2, object fields can be resolved by only one subgraph).

```graphql {2-3}
type Position {
  x: Int! @shareable
  y: Int! @shareable
}
```

If applied to an object type definition, _all_ of that type's fields are considered `@shareable`:

```graphql {1}
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

If a field is marked `@shareable` in _any_ subgraph, it **must** be marked as either `@shareable` or [`@external`](#external) in _every_ Federation 2 subgraph that defines it.

> If a Federation 2 supergraph includes a Federation 1 subgraph, all value types in the Federation 1 subgraph are automatically considered `@shareable` by the Federation 2 composition algorithm.

If a field is included in an entity's [`@key` directive](#key), that field is automatically considered `@shareable` and the directive is not required in the corresponding subgraph(s).

See also [Value types in Apollo Federation](./sharing-types/) and [Resolving another subgraph's field](../entities-advanced/#resolving-another-subgraphs-field).

### `@inaccessible`

```graphql
directive @inaccessible on FIELD_DEFINITION | INTERFACE | OBJECT | UNION | ARGUMENT_DEFINITION | SCALAR | ENUM | ENUM_VALUE | INPUT_OBJECT | INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION
```

Indicates that a definition in the subgraph schema should be _omitted_ from the gateway's [API schema](./overview/#api-schema), _even if that definition is also present in other subgraphs_. This means that the field is not exposed to clients at all.

Common use cases for `@inaccessible` include:

* Avoiding composition errors while making staggered updates to a definition that's shared across multiple subgraphs (such as a [value type](./sharing-types/#adding-new-shared-fields))
* Using a private field as part of an entity's [`@key`](#key) without exposing that field to clients

<CodeColumns>

```graphql {4} title="Subgraph A"
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  z: Int! @inaccessible
}
```

```graphql {4} title="Subgraph B"
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  # Subgraph is not yet updated
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Often when you add a field to a value type in _one_ subgraph, composition fails because that field isn't resolvable in _other_ subgraphs. With `@inaccessible`, you can preserve composition while adding the field to your remaining subgraphs. When the rollout is complete, you can remove the directive and begin using the field.

An `@inaccessible` field or type is _not_ omitted from the _supergraph_ schema, so the graph router still knows it exists (but clients can't include it in operations). This is what enables the graph router to use an `@inaccessible` field as part of an entity's `@key` when combining entity fields from multiple subgraphs.

**If a type is marked `@inaccessible`, all fields that return that type must also be marked `@inaccessible`.** Otherwise, a composition error occurs.

For more information, see [Using `@inaccessible`](./sharing-types/#using-inaccessible).

### `@override`

```graphql
directive @override(from: String!) on FIELD_DEFINITION
```

Indicates that an object field is now resolved by this subgraph _instead of_ another subgraph where it's also defined. This enables you to migrate a field from one subgraph to another.

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Products subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  inStock: Boolean!
}
```

```graphql {3} title="Inventory subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  inStock: Boolean! @override(from: "Products")
}
```

</CodeColumns>

In the example above, we're migrating the `Product.inStock` field from the Products subgraph to the Inventory subgraph. The composed supergraph schema indicates that `Product.inStock` is resolved by the Inventory subgraph but _not_ the Products subgraph, even though the Products subgraph also defines the field.

You can apply `@override` to a [`@shareable`](#shareable) field. If you do, only the subgraph you provide in the `from` argument no longer resolves that field. _Other_ subgraphs can still resolve the field.

Only one subgraph can `@override` any given field. If multiple subgraphs attempt to `@override` the same field, a composition error occurs.

For more information, see [Migrating entities and fields](../entities-advanced/#migrating-entities-and-fields).

#### Arguments

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr class="required">
<td>

##### `from`

`String`
</td>
<td>

**Required.** The name of the other subgraph that no longer resolves the field.

* **If you're performing composition with managed federation,** this must match the name of the subgraph in Apollo Studio.
* **If you're performing composition with the Rover CLI,** this must match the name of the subgraph in the YAML config file you provide to `rover supergraph compose`.

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

## Referencing external fields

### `@external`

```graphql
directive @external on FIELD_DEFINITION
```

Indicates that this subgraph usually _can't_ resolve a particular object field, but it still needs to define that field for other purposes.

This directive is always used in combination with another directive that references object fields, such as [`@provides`](#provides) or [`@requires`](#requires).

```graphql {3,8} title="Inventory subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @external
  inStock: Boolean!
}

type Query {
  outOfStockProducts: [Product!]! @provides(fields: "name")
  discontinuedProducts: [Product!]!
}
```

This example subgraph _usually_ can't resolve the `Product.name` field, but it _can_ at the `Query.outOfStockProducts` query path (indicated by the [`@provides` directive](#provides)).


### `@provides`

```graphql
directive @provides(fields: FieldSet!) on FIELD_DEFINITION
```

Specifies a set of entity fields that a subgraph _can_ resolve, but _only_ at a particular schema path (at other paths, the subgraph _can't_ resolve those fields).

If a subgraph can _always_ resolve a particular entity field, do _not_ apply this directive.

**Using this directive is always an optional optimization.** It can reduce the total number of subgraphs that your graph router needs to communicate with to resolve certain operations, which can improve performance.

```graphql {3,8} title="Inventory subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @external
  inStock: Boolean!
}

type Query {
  outOfStockProducts: [Product!]! @provides(fields: "name")
  discontinuedProducts: [Product!]!
}
```

This example subgraph can resolve `Product.name` for products returned by `Query.outOfStockProducts` but _not_ `Query.discontinuedProducts`.

> **If a subgraph `@provides` an entity field:**
>
> * The subgraph must define that field and mark it as [`@external`](#external), as shown above with `Product.name`.
> * The entity field must be marked as either [`@shareable`](#shareable) or [`@external`](#external) in _every_ subgraph that defines it.
> * The entity field must be marked as [`@shareable`](#shareable) in at least one other subgraph (i.e., there's at least one subgraph that can _always_ resolve the field).
>
> Otherwise, a composition error occurs.

For more information, see [Using `@provides`](/federation/entities-advanced#using-provides).

#### Arguments

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr class="required">
<td>

##### `fields`

</td>
<td>

**Required.** A GraphQL selection set (provided as a string) of object fields and subfields that the subgraph can resolve only at _this_ query path.

Examples:

* `"name"`
* `"name address"`
* `"... on Person { name address }"` (valid for fields that return a union or interface)

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

### `@requires`

```graphql
directive @requires(fields: FieldSet!) on FIELD_DEFINITION
```

Indicates that the resolver for a particular entity field depends on the values of _other_ entity fields that are resolved by _other_ subgraphs. This tells the graph router that it needs to fetch the values of those externally defined fields _first_, even if the original client query didn't request them.

```graphql {5} title="Shipping subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  size: Int @external
  weight: Int @external
  shippingEstimate: String @requires(fields: "size weight")
}
```

The example subgraph above resolves a `Product` object's `shippingEstimate` field, but it requires the product's `size` and `weight` to do so. Because these two fields are resolved by a different subgraph, they're marked as [`@external`](#external).

> **If a subgraph `@requires` an entity field,** the subgraph must define that field and mark it as [`@external`](#external), as shown above with `Product.size` and `Product.weight`. Otherwise, a composition error occurs.

      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr class="required">
<td>

##### `fields`

</td>
<td>

**Required.** A GraphQL selection set (provided as a string) of `@external` object fields and subfields that this field requires.

Examples:

* `"name"`
* `"name address"`
* `"name organization { id }"`

</td>
</tr>
