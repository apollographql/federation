title: Federation-specific GraphQL directives
---

Apollo Federation defines a collection of **directives** that you use in your subgraph schemas to enable certain features.

## Importing directives

To use federated directives in a Federation 2 subgraph schema, apply the `@link` directive with the following format to the `schema` type:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0",
        import: ["@key", "@shareable"])
```

You can apply this directive to your existing `schema` declaration if you have one, or to a new `extend schema` declaration (as shown above).

Modify the `import` array to include whichever federated directives your subgraph schema uses. The example above imports the [`@key`](#key) and [`@shareable`](#shareable) directives (which are used most commonly).

> Make sure to include the `@` in each directive name!

### Renaming directives

If a federated directive's name matches one of your own custom directives, you can rename the federated directive with the following syntax:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0",
        import: [{ name: "@key", as: "@primaryKey"}, "@shareable"])
```

This example subgraph schema uses `@primaryKey` for the federated directive usually named [`@key`](#key).

## Managing entities

### `@key`

Designates an object type as an [entity](../entities/).

**Valid locations:** Object type definitions

```graphql {1}
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Int
}
```

#### Arguments

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr class="required">
<td>

##### `fields`

</td>
<td>

**Required.** A GraphQL selection set (provided as a string) of fields and subfields that contribute to the entity's primary key.

Examples:

* `"id"`
* `"username region"`
* `"name organization { id }"`

See also [Advanced `@key`s](../entities-advanced/#advanced-keys).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `resolvable`

`Boolean`
</td>
<td>

If `false`, informs the gateway that this subgraph _doesn't_ define a [reference resolver](../entities/#2-define-a-reference-resolver) for this entity. This means that gateway query plans can't "jump to" this subgraph to resolve fields that aren't defined in _another_ subgraph.

Most commonly, you set this to `false` when [referencing an entity without contributing fields](../entities/#referencing-an-entity-without-contributing-fields).

The default value is `true`.

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

## Managing shared fields

### `@shareable`

Indicates that an object type's field is allowed to be resolved by multiple subgraphs (by default, each field can be resolved by only one subgraph).

**Valid locations:** Field definitions; Object type definitions

```graphql {2-3}
type Position {
  x: Int! @shareable
  y: Int! @shareable
}
```

If applied to an object type definition, _all_ of that type's fields are considered `@shareable`:

```graphql {1}
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

See also [Value types in Apollo Federation](./sharing-types/) and [Resolving another subgraph's field](../entities-advanced/#resolving-another-subgraphs-field).

### `@inaccessible`

Indicates that a field or type should be _omitted_ from the gateway's API schema, _even if it's also defined in other subgraphs_.

**Valid locations:** Field definitions; Type definitions for objects, interfaces, and unions

```graphql {4}
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  z: Int! @inaccessible
}
```

An `@inaccessible` field or type is _not_ omitted from the _supergraph_ schema, so the gateway still knows it exists (but clients can't include it in operations).

**If a type is marked `@inaccessible`, all fields that return that type must also be marked `@inaccessible`.** Otherwise, a composition error occurs.

The `@inaccessible` directive is helpful for [adding a new field to a shared value type](./sharing-types/#adding-new-shared-fields). Often when you add a value type field in _one_ subgraph, composition fails because that field isn't resolvable in _other_ subgraphs. This directive enables you to preserve composition while adding the field to your remaining subgraphs. When the rollout is complete, you can remove the `@inaccessible` directive and begin using the field.

### `@override`

Indicates that a field is now resolved by this subgraph _instead of_ another subgraph where it's also defined.

**Valid locations:** Field definitions

```graphql {3} title="Inventory subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  inStock: Boolean! @override(from: "Products")
}
```

You use `@override` to migrate a field from one subgraph to another. In the example above, we're migrating the `Product.inStock` field from the Products subgraph to the Inventory subgraph. The composed supergraph schema indicates that `Product.inStock` is resolved by the Inventory subgraph but _not_ the Products subgraph, even though the Products subgraph also defines the field.

You can apply `@override` to a [`@shareable`](#shareable) field. If you do, only the subgraph you provide in the `from` argument no longer resolves that field. _Other_ subgraphs can still resolve the field.

For more information, see [Migrating entities and fields](../entities-advanced/#migrating-entities-and-fields).

#### Arguments

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr class="required">
<td>

##### `from`

`String`
</td>
<td>

**Required.** The name of the other subgraph that no longer resolves the field.

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

## Referencing external fields

### `@external`

Indicates that a particular subgraph _can't_ resolve a particular object field in most cases, but the subgraph still needs to define that field for other purposes. Most commonly used in combination with [`@provides`](#provides) and/or [`@requires`](#requires).

**Valid locations:** Field definitions

```graphql {3} title="Inventory subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @external
  inStock: Boolean!
}

type Query {
  outOfStockProducts: [Product!]! @provides(fields: "name")
  discontinuedProducts: [Product!]!
}
```

The example subgraph above _usually_ can't resolve the `Product.name` field, but it _can_ at the `Query.outOfStockProducts` query path.


### `@provides`

Indicates that a particular subgraph can resolve particular fields, but _only_ at a particular query path.

**Valid locations:** Field definitions

```graphql {8} title="Inventory subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @external
  inStock: Boolean!
}

type Query {
  outOfStockProducts: [Product!]! @provides(fields: "name")
  discontinuedProducts: [Product!]!
}
```

The example subgraph above can resolve `Product.name` for products returned by `Query.outOfStockProducts` but _not_ `Query.discontinuedProducts`.

> If a subgraph `@provides` a particular field that it can't _always_ resolve:
>
> * The subgraph must define that field and mark it as [`@external`](#external), as shown above.
> * That field must be marked as either [`@shareable`](#shareable) or [`@external`](#external) in _every_ subgraph that defines it.
>
> Otherwise, a composition error occurs.

#### Arguments

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr class="required">
<td>

##### `fields`

</td>
<td>

**Required.** A GraphQL selection set (provided as a string) of object fields and subfields that the subgraph can resolve only at _this_ query path.

Examples:

* `"name"`
* `"name address"`
* `"... on Person { name address }"` (valid for fields that return a union or interface)

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

### `@requires`

Indicates that a particular object field's resolver requires the values of _other_ fields that are resolved by _other_ subgraphs.

**Valid locations:** Field definitions

```graphql {5} title="Shipping subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  size: Int @external
  weight: Int @external
  shippingEstimate: String @requires(fields: "size weight")
}
```

The example subgraph above resolves a `Product` object's `shippingEstimate` field, but it requires the product's `size` and `weight` to do so. These two fields are resolved by a different subgraph, so they're marked as [`@external`](#external).

See also [Contributing computed entity fields](../entities-advanced/#contributing-computed-entity-fields).

#### Arguments

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr class="required">
<td>

##### `fields`

</td>
<td>

**Required.** A GraphQL selection set (provided as a string) of `@external` object fields and subfields that this field requires.

Examples:

* `"name"`
* `"name address"`
* `"name organization { id }"`

</td>
</tr>
