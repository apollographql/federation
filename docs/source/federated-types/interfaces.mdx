Apollo Federation provides powerful extensions to GraphQL interfaces, specifically for use with your supergraph's [entities](../entities/):

1. Apply the `@key` directive to an `interface` definition to make it an _entity interface_.
2. In other subgraphs, use the `@interfaceObject` directive to automatically add fields to every entity that implements your entity interface.

With these extensions, your subgraphs can quickly contribute sets of fields to multiple entities, without needing to duplicate any existing (or future) entity definitions.

## Example schemas

Let's look at a supergraph that defines a `Media` entity interface, along with a `Book` entity that implements it:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Subgraph A"
interface Media @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}

type Book implements Media @key(fields: "id"){
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
```

```graphql title="Subgraph B"
type Media @key(fields: "id") @interfaceObject {
  id: ID!
  reviews: [Review!]!
}

type Review {
  score: Int!
}

type Query {
  topRatedMedia: [Media!]!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

This example is short, but there's a lot to it! Let's break it down:

- **Subgraph A** defines the `Media` interface, along with the implementing `Book` entity.
    - The `Media` interface uses the `@key` directive, which makes it an entity interface.
    - This usage requires that all objects implementing `Media` are entities, and that those entities all use the specified `@key`(s).
    - As shown, `Book` is an entity and it does use the single specified `@key`.
- **Subgraph B** wants to add a `reviews` field to every entity that implements `Media`.
    - To achieve this, Subgraph B also defines `Media`, but as an object type! [Learn why this is necessary](#why-is-interfaceobject-necessary).
    - Subgraph B applies the `@interfaceObject` directive to `Media`, which indicates that the object corresponds to another subgraph's entity interface.
    - Subgraph B applies the exact same `@key`(s) to `Media` that Subgraph A does, and it also defines all `@key` fields (in this case, just `id`).
    - Subgraph B defines the new `Media.reviews` field.
    - Subgraph B will also be responsible for resolving the `reviews` field. To learn how, see [Resolving an `@interfaceObject`](#resolving-an-interfaceobject).

When [composition](./composition/) runs for the above subgraph schemas, it identifies Subgraph B's `@interfaceObject`. It adds the new `reviews` field to the supergraph schema's `Media` interface, and it also adds that field to the implementing `Book` entity (along with any others):

```graphql title="Supergraph schema (simplified)"
interface Media @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  reviews: [Review!]! #highlight-line
}

type Book implements Media @key(fields: "id"){
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  reviews: [Review!]! #highlight-line
}

type Review {
  score: Int!
}
```

> Subgraph B could have added `Book.reviews` by [contributing the field](../entities#contributing-entity-fields) directly to the entity as usual. However, what if we wanted to add `reviews` to a hundred different entity implementations of `Media`?
>
> By instead adding entity fields via `@interfaceObject`, we can avoid redefining a hundred entities in Subgraph B (not to mention adding more definitions whenever a new implementing entity is created). [Learn more.](#why-is-interfaceobject-necessary)

## Requirements

To use entity interfaces and `@interfaceObject`, your supergraph must adhere to all of the following requirements. Otherwise, composition will fail.

### Enabling support

- If they don't already, all of your subgraph schemas must use the [`@link` directive](./federated-directives/#importing-directives) to enable Federation 2 features.
- Any subgraph schema that uses the `@interfaceObject` directive or applies `@key` to an `interface` must target `v2.3` or later of the Apollo Federation specfication:

    ```graphql
    extend schema
      @link(
      #highlight-start
      url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.3"
      import: ["@key", "@interfaceObject"]
      #highlight-end
      )
    ```

    Additionally, schemas that use `@interfaceObject` must include it in the [`@link` directive's](./federated-directives/#importing-directives) `import` array as shown above.

### Usage rules

#### The `interface` definition

Let's say Subgraph A defines the `MyInterface` type as an entity interface so that other subgraphs can add fields to it:

```graphql title="Subgraph A"
interface MyInterface @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  originalField: String!
}

type MyObject implements MyInterface @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  originalField: String!
}
```

In this case:

- Subgraph A must include at least one `@key` directive in its `MyInterface` definition.
    - It may include multiple `@key`s.
- Subgraph A must define every entity type in your entire supergraph that implements `MyInterface`.
    - Certain other subgraphs can also define these entities, but Subgraph A must define all of them.
    - You can think of a subgraph that defines an entity interface as also  owning every entity that implements that interface.
- Subgraph A must be able to uniquely identify any instance of any entity that implements `MyInterface`, using only the `@key` fields defined by `MyInterface`.
    - In other words, if `EntityA` and `EntityB` both implement `MyInterface`, no instance of `EntityA` can have the exact same values for its `@key` fields as any instance of `EntityB`.
    - This uniqueness requirement is always true among instances of a single entity. With entity interfaces, this requirement extends across instances of all implementing entities.
    - This is required to support deterministically [resolving the interface](#required-resolvers) in Subgraph A.
- Every entity that implements `MyInterface` must include all `@key`s from the `MyInterface` definition.
    - These entities can optionally define additional `@key`s as needed.

#### `@interfaceObject` definitions

Let's say Subgraph B applies `@interfaceObject` to an object type named `MyInterface`:

```graphql title="Subgraph B"
type MyInterface @key(fields: "id") @interfaceObject {
  id: ID!
  addedField: Int!
}
```

In this case:

- At least one other subgraph must define an interface type named `MyInterface` with the `@key` directive applied to it (e.g., [Subgraph A above](#the-interface-definition))

    ```graphql title="Subgraph A"
    interface MyInterface @key(fields: "id") {
      id: ID!
      originalField: String!
    }
    ```

- every subgraph that defines `MyInterface` as an object type must:
    - Apply `@interfaceObject` to its definition
    - Include the exact same `@key`(s) as the interface type's definition
- Subgraph B must not also define `MyInterface` as an interface type.
- Subgraph B must not define any entity that implements `MyInterface`.
    - If a subgraph contributes entity fields via `@interfaceObject`, it "gives up" the ability to contribute fields to any individual entity that implements that interface.

### Required resolvers

#### `interface` reference resolver

In [the example schemas above](#example-schemas), Subgraph A defines `Media` as an entity interface, which includes applying the `@key` directive to it:

```graphql title="Subgraph A"
interface Media @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
```

As it does with any [standard entity](../entities/#1-define-a-key), `@key` indicates "this subgraph can resolve any instance of this type if provided its `@key` fields." This means Subgraph A needs to define a reference resolver for `Media`, just as it would for any other entity.

> The method for defining a reference resolver depends on which [subgraph library](../building-supergraphs/supported-subgraphs/) you use. Some subgraph libraries might use a different term for this functionality. Consult your library's documentation for details.

Here's an example reference resolver for `Media` if using Apollo Server with the `@apollo/subgraph` library:

```js
Media: {
  __resolveReference(representation) {
    return allMedia.find((obj) => obj.id === representation.id);
  },
},

// ....other resolvers ...
```

In this example, the hypothetical variable `allMedia` contains all `Media` data, including each object's `id`.


#### `@interfaceObject` resolvers

##### Field resolvers

In [the example schemas above](#example-schemas), Subgraph B defines `Media` as an object type and applies `@interfaceObject` to it. It also defines a `Query.topRatedMedia` field:

```graphql title="Subgraph B"
type Media @key(fields: "id") @interfaceObject {
  id: ID!
  reviews: [Review!]!
}

type Review {
  score: Int!
}

type Query {
  topRatedMedia: [Media!]!
}
```

Subgraph B needs to define a resolver for the new `topRatedMedia` field, along with any other fields that return the `Media` type.

Remember: from the perspective of Subgraph B, `Media` is an object! Therefore, you create resolvers for it using the same sort of logic that you would use for any other object. Subgraph B only needs to be able to resolve the `Media` fields that it knows about (`id` and `reviews`).

##### Reference resolver

Notice that in Subgraph B, `Media` is an object type with `@key` applied. Therefore, it's a standard entity! As with any entity definition, it also requires a corresponding reference resolver:

```js
Media: {
  __resolveReference(representation) {
    return allMedia.find((obj) => obj.id === representation.id);
  },
},

// ....other resolvers ...
```

## Why is `@interfaceObject` necessary?

Without the `@interfaceObject` directive and its associated composition logic, distributing an interface type's definition across subgraphs can impose continual maintenance requirements on your subgraph teams.

Let's look at an example that doesn't use `@interfaceObject`. Here, Subgraph A defines the `Media` interface, along with two implementing entities:

```graphql title="Subgraph A"
interface Media {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}

type Book implements Media @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  author: String!
}

type Movie implements Media @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  director: String!
}
```

Now, if Subgraph B wants to add a `reviews` field to the `Media` interface, it can't just define that field:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">❌</p>

```graphql title="Subgraph B"
interface Media {
  reviews: [Review!]!
}

type Review {
  score: Int!
}

type Query {
  topRatedMedia: [Media!]!
}
```

This addition breaks composition. In the supergraph schema, the `Media` interface now defines the `reviews` field, but neither `Book` nor `Movie` does!

For this to work, Subgraph B also needs to add the `reviews` field to every entity that implements `Media`:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">⚠️</p>

```graphql
interface Media {
  reviews: [Review!]!
}

type Review {
  score: Int!
}

type Book implements Media @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  reviews: [Review!]!
}

type Movie implements Media @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  reviews: [Review!]!
}
```

This resolves our current composition error, but composition will break again whenever Subgraph A defines a new entity that implements `Media`:

```graphql title="Subgraph A"
type Podcast implements Media @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
```

To prevent these composition errors, the teams maintaining Subgraph A and Subgraph B need to coordinate their schema changes every time a new implementation of `Media` is created. Imagine how complex that coordination becomes if the definition of `Media` is instead distributed across ten subgraphs!

In summary, Subgraph B shouldn't need to know every possible kind of `Media` that exists in your supergraph. Instead, it should generically know how to fetch reviews for any kind of `Media`. This is the relationship that entity interfaces and `@interfaceObject` provide, as demonstrated in the [example above](#example-schemas).


### Are there alternatives to using `@interfaceObject`?

The primary alternative to using `@interfaceObject` is to use the discouraged strategy described in the [previous section](#why-is-interfaceobject-necessary). This requires duplicating all implementations of a given interface in each subgraph that contributes fields to that interface.

Note that this alternative also requires that each subgraph can resolve the type of any object that implements the interface. In many cases, a particular subgraph can't do this, which means this alternative is not feasible.
