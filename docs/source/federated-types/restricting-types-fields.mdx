> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This article describes directives that are _not yet supported_ in this alpha release of Apollo Federation 2. They are documented here to provide clarity into planned capabilities of the eventual full release.

In a federated graph, types and fields can [cross subgraph boundaries](./types-fields/), appearing in more than one subgraph schema:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

```graphql
# Subgraph B
type Position {
  x: Int
  y: Int
  z: Int
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Sometimes this is undesirable, and you want one particular subgraph to "own" a particular type or field. Federation 2 will support directives to enforce different forms of ownership:

| Directive | Applied to | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| [`@final`](#final) | Fields | The field must be defined _and_ resolved by exactly one subgraph. |
| [`@override`](#override) | Fields | The field must be _resolved_ by exactly one subgraph (it can be _defined_ by many). |
| [`@shared`](#shared) | Fields | Removes the default `@final` behavior of certain fields. |
| [`@inaccessible`](#inaccessible) | Both | The field or type is omitted from the API schema entirely. |
| [`@entity`](#entity) | Types | The type is designated an [entity](../entities/) and all of its fields are considered `@final` by default. |
| [`@canonical`](#canonical) | Types | The type must be defined identically in every subgraph that defines it. |

## `@final`

If a field should only be defined _and_ resolved by a single subgraph, you can apply the `@final` directive to that field:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">‚ùå</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{3}
# Subgraph A
type Dog {
  breed: String! @final
}
```

```graphql{3}
# Subgraph B
type Dog {
  breed: String! # Can't define!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

In this example, only Subgraph A can define the `Dog.breed` field. If another subgraph attempts to define it, composition fails. This is true even if another subgraph applies the the [`@override` directive](#override) to the field.

To migrate a `@final` field to another subgraph, you must first remove its `@final` directive.

## `@override`

If a field is defined in multiple subgraphs, you can use the `@override` directive to require that the field is always _resolved_ by a _particular_ subgraph:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Dog {
  breed: String!
}
```

```graphql{3}
# Subgraph B
type Dog {
  breed: String! @override
}
```

</CodeColumns>

In this example, only Subgraph B's definition of `Dog.breed` is used by your gateway's query planner, and the field is never resolved by Subgraph A.

**This can break composition!** If Subgraph A supports a query that returns a `Dog` and Subgraph B _doesn't_ support that query, there is now no way for that query to return `Dog.breed`.

Only one subgraph can `@override` a particular field. Otherwise, composition fails.

> The `@override` directive is especially helpful when you're migrating a field from one subgraph to another.



## `@shared`

Certain fields in a subgraph schema are considered [`@final`](#final) _by default_. These include:

* Fields of the root `Query` and `Mutation` types
* Fields of [entities](../entities/)

Because these fields are considered `@final`, other subgraphs can't define or resolve them. You can override this default behavior by adding the `@shared` directive to every subgraph that defines a field:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{3}
# Subgraph A
type Query {
  books: [Book!]! @shared
}
```

```graphql{3}
# Subgraph B
type Query {
  books: [Book] @shared
  movies: [Movie!]!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

In this example, both Subgraph A and Subgraph B can resolve `Query.books`. They can even define different return types if those return types are [compatible](types-fields/#inconsistent-field-return-types).

> The `@shared` directive does _not_ override an explicit use of the `@final` directive. It only overrides the behavior of fields that are considered `@final` by default.

## `@inaccessible`

If a field in your subgraph schema shouldn't appear in your gateway's API schema _at all_, you can apply the `@inaccessible` directive to that field:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{4}
# Subgraph A
type Dog {
  breed: String!
  name: String! @inaccessible
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

**This can break composition if another subgraph defines the same field.** If Subgraph A supports a query that returns a `Dog` and Subgraph B defines `Dog.name`, `Dog.name` can't be resolved unless Subgraph B _also_ supports that query.

> An `@inaccessible` field still appears in your _supergraph_ schema, so your gateway can still use it for internal routing purposes. _Clients_ cannot include the field in operations.

## `@entity`

You use the `@entity` directive to indicate that an object type is an entity ([learn about entities](../entities/)).

All of an entity's fields are considered [`@final`](#final) by default. You can override this behavior with the [`@shared`](#shared) directive.

## `@canonical`

If an object type is defined in multiple subgraphs, you can use the `@canonical` directive to require that it is defined **identically** in each of those subgraphs:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">‚ùå</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{4}
# Subgraph A
type Dog @canonical {
  breed: String!
  name: String!
}
```

```graphql{4}
# Subgraph B
type Dog {
  breed: String!
  # Missing name!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

In this example, Subgraph A's definition of `Dog` is `@canonical`, and Subgraph B's definition is missing the `name` field. This breaks composition.

Subgraph B _can_ omit the `name` field if Subgraph A defines a [`@default` value](./composition/#set-a-default-value-for-the-field-coming-soon) for it:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">‚úÖ</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{4}
# Subgraph A
type Dog @canonical {
  breed: String!
  name: String! @default(value: "Rover")
}
```

```graphql{4}
# Subgraph B
type Dog {
  breed: String!
  # Missing name OK
}
```

</CodeColumns>
