This article describes:

* How to use types and fields across multiple subgraph schemas in a federated graph
* Scenarios where cross-subgraph types and fields can [break composition](./composition/#breaking-composition)

## Introduction

In a federated graph, each subgraph has its own schema, which defines types and fields for the data that the subgraph can provide.

Each subgraph's schema is distinct, but types and fields in those schemas might overlap. For example, multiple subgraph schemas might define the _same_ type, possibly with _different fields:_

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

```graphql
# Subgraph B
type Position {
  x: Int
  y: Int
  z: Int
}
```

</CodeColumns>

In cases like these, **types and fields cross subgraph boundaries**. Apollo Federation supports this, _as long as your supergraph schema can compose successfully_. Some of these cases require you to add special syntax to your subgraph schemas.

Let's take a look at common cases when using a type or field definition across subgraphs with Apollo Federation.

## Inconsistent field return types

Let's say two subgraphs both define an `Event` object type with a `timestamp` field:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">❌</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{3}
# Subgraph A
type Event {
  timestamp: Int!
}
```

```graphql{3}
# Subgraph B
type Event {
  timestamp: String!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Subgraph A's `timestamp` returns an `Int`, and Subgraph B's returns a `String`. **This is invalid.** When composition attempts to generate an `Event` type for the supergraph schema, it fails due to an unresolvable conflict between the two `timestamp` definitions.

Next, look at these inconsistent definitions for the `Position` object type:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">✅</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

```graphql
# Subgraph B
type Position {
  x: Int
  y: Int
}
```

</CodeColumns>

The `x` and `y` fields are _non-nullable_ in subgraph A, but they're _nullable_ in subgraph B. **This is valid!** Composition recognizes that it can use the following definition for `Position` in the supergraph schema:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Supergraph schema
type Position {
  x: Int
  y: Int
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

This definition works for querying Subgraph A, because Subgraph A's definition is _more restrictive_ than this (a non-nullable value is always valid for a nullable field). In this case, composition [**coerces**](#supported-field-coercions) Subgraph A's `Position` fields to satisfy the reduced restrictiveness of Subgraph B.

> Note that Subgraph A's actual subgraph schema is _not_ modified. Within Subgraph A, `x` and `y` remain non-nullable.

### Supported field coercions

Composition can use coercion to handle differences in field **nullability** and/or **lists**. Look at these inconsistent definitions of a `Document` object type:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">✅</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Document {
  # Most recent timestamp
  lastModified: String
}
```

```graphql
# Subgraph B
type Document {
  # List of timestamps
  lastModified: [String!]!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

In this case, composition generates the following supergraph schema definition of `Document`:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Supergraph schema
type Document {
  lastModified: [String]!
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

* This `lastModified` definition works for Subgraph A, which returns a single nullable `String`. The gateway can transform the single `String` into a one-item list.
* This definition _also_ works for Subgraph B, because the nullability of list items is _less restrictive_ than Subgraph B's.

## Missing object fields

Look at these two definitions of a `Position` object type:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">⚠️</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

```graphql
# Subgraph B
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  z: Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Subgraph B defines a `z` field, but Subgraph A doesn't. In this case, when composition generates the `Position` type for the supergraph schema, it includes all three fields:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Supergraph schema
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  z: Int!
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>


**This definition works for Subgraph B, but it presents a problem for Subgraph A.** Let's say Subgraph A defines the following `Query` type:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Query {
  currentPosition: Position!
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

According to the hypothetical supergraph schema, the following query is valid against the supergraph:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">❌</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
query GetCurrentPosition {
  currentPosition {
    x
    y
    z # ⚠️ Can't be resolved! ⚠️
  }
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

And here's the problem: if Subgraph B _doesn't_ define `Query.currentPosition`, this query _must_ be executed on Subgraph A. But Subgraph A is missing the `Position.z` field, so that field is **unresolvable**!

**Composition recognizes this potential problem, and it fails with an error.** So how do we fix it? Check out [Solutions for unresolvable fields](./composition/#solutions-for-unresolvable-fields).
