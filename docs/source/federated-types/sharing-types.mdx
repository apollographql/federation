title: Value types in Apollo Federation
description: Share types and fields across multiple subgraphs
---

In a federated graph, it's common to want to reuse a GraphQL type across multiple [subgraphs](../building-supergraphs/subgraphs-overview/).

For example, suppose you want to define and reuse a generic `Position` type in different subgraphs:

```graphql
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

Types like this are called **value types**. This article describes how to share value types and their fields in federated graph, enabling multiple subgraphs to define and resolve them.

## Sharing object types

By default in [Federation 2 subgraphs](../federation-2/moving-to-federation-2/#step-3-update-individual-subgraphs), a single object field _can't_ be defined or resolved by more than one subgraph schema.

Consider the following `Position` example:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">❌</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql {2-3} title="Subgraph A"
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

```graphql {2-3} title="Subgraph B"
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```
<></>

</CodeColumns>

Attempting to compose these two subgraph schemas together will [break composition](./composition/#breaking-composition). The router doesn't know _which subgraph_ is responsible for resolving `Position.x` and `Position.y`. To enable multiple subgraphs to resolve these fields, you must first mark that field as [`@shareable`](#using-shareable).

> As an alternative, if you want Subgraphs A and B to resolve _different_ fields of `Position`, you can designate the `Position` type as an [entity](../entities).

### Using `@shareable`

The `@shareable` directive enables multiple subgraphs to resolve a particular object field (or set of object fields).

To use `@shareable` in a subgraph schema, you first need to add the following snippet to that schema to [opt in to Federation 2](../federation-2/moving-to-federation-2/#opt-in-to-federation-2):

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.3",
        import: ["@key", "@shareable"])
```

Then you can apply the `@shareable` directive to an object type, or to _individual fields_ of that type:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">✅</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql {1} title="Subgraph A"
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

```graphql {2-3} title="Subgraph B"
type Position {
  x: Int! @shareable
  y: Int! @shareable
}
```
<></>

</CodeColumns>

> Marking a type as `@shareable` is equivalent to marking _all_ of its fields as `@shareable`, so the two subgraph definitions above are equivalent.

Both subgraphs A _and_ B can now resolve the `x` and `y` fields for the `Position` type, and our subgraph schemas will successfully compose into a supergraph schema.

#### ⚠️ Important considerations for `@shareable`

* If a type or field is marked `@shareable` in _any_ subgraph, it must be marked either `@shareable` or [`@external`](./federated-directives/#external) in _every_ subgraph that defines it. Otherwise, composition fails.
* If multiple subgraphs can resolve a field, **make sure each subgraph's resolver for that field behaves identically.** Otherwise, queries might return inconsistent results depending on which subgraph resolves the field.

#### Using `@shareable` with `extend`

If you apply `@shareable` to an object type declaration, it only applies to the fields within that _exact_ declaration. It does _not_ apply to _other_ declarations for that same type:

```graphql title="Subgraph A"
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int! # shareable
  y: Int! # shareable
}

extend type Position {
  # highlight-start
  z: Int! # ⚠️ NOT shareable!
  # highlight-end
}
```

Using the `extend` keyword, the schema above includes two different declarations for `Position`. Because only the first declaration is marked `@shareable`, `Position.z` is _not_ considered shareable.

To make `Position.z` shareable, you can do one of the following:

- Mark the individual field `z` with `@shareable`.

    ```graphql
    extend type Position {
      # highlight-start
      z: Int! @shareable
      # highlight-end
    }
    ```

- Mark the entire `extend` declaration with `@shareable`.

    - **This strategy requires targeting `v2.2` or later of the Apollo Federation specification in your subgraph schema!** Earlier versions do not support applying `@shareable` to the same object type multiple times.

    ```graphql
    extend schema
      @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.3", import: ["@shareable"]) #highlight-line

    extend type Position @shareable { #highlight-line
      z: Int!
    }
    ```

## Differing shared fields

Shared fields can differ between subgraphs in specific ways:
* The return type of a shared field can vary in nullability (`String` / `String!`).
  * A shared field's return type _can't_ vary in its core type (`Int` vs. `String`) or in whether it returns a list (`Int` vs. `[Int]`).
* A field can be omitted from a subgraph, _if_ that field is always [resolvable](../federated-types/composition/#rules-of-composition).

For example, take a look at the shared `Food` type below:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql {3} title="Subgraph A"
type Food @shareable {
  name: String!
  price: Int!
}
```

```graphql {3-4} title="Subgraph B"
type Food @shareable {
  name: String!
  price: Int # Nullable
  inStock: Boolean! # Not in A
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

The above `Food` types differ in the nullability of their fields _and_ the fields included in each type.

### Return types

Let's say two subgraphs both define an `Event` object type with a `timestamp` field:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">❌</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql {2} title="Subgraph A"
type Event @shareable {
  timestamp: Int!
}
```

```graphql {2} title="Subgraph B"
type Event @shareable {
  timestamp: String!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Subgraph A's `timestamp` returns an `Int`, and Subgraph B's returns a `String`. **This is invalid.** When composition attempts to generate an `Event` type for the supergraph schema, it fails due to an unresolvable conflict between the two `timestamp` field definitions.

Next, look at these varying definitions for the `Position` object type:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">✅</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql {2-3} title="Subgraph A"
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

```graphql {2-3} title="Subgraph B"
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int
  y: Int
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

The `x` and `y` fields are _non-nullable_ in Subgraph A, but they're _nullable_ in Subgraph B. **This is valid!** Composition recognizes that it can use the following definition for `Position` in the supergraph schema:


```graphql title="Supergraph schema"
type Position {
  x: Int
  y: Int
}
```

This definition works for querying Subgraph A, because Subgraph A's definition is _more restrictive_ than this (a non-nullable value is always valid for a nullable field). In this case, composition **coerces** Subgraph A's `Position` fields to satisfy the reduced restrictiveness of Subgraph B.

> Note that Subgraph A's actual subgraph schema is _not_ modified. Within Subgraph A, `x` and `y` remain non-nullable.

### Arguments

Arguments for a shared field can differ between subgraphs in certain ways:

* If an argument is _required_ in at least one subgraph, it can be _optional_ in other subgraphs. **It cannot be omitted.**
* If an argument is _optional in every subgraph where it's defined_, it is _technically valid_ to omit it in other subgraphs. _However:_
    * ⚠️ **If a field argument is omitted from any subgraph, that argument is omitted from the supergraph schema entirely!** This means that clients _can't_ provide the argument for that field.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">✅</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql {3} title="Subgraph A"
type Building @shareable {
  # Argument is required
  height(units: String!): Int!
}
```

```graphql {3} title="Subgraph B"
type Building @shareable {
  # Argument can be optional
  height(units: String): Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">❌</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql {3} title="Subgraph A"
type Building @shareable {
  # Argument is required
  height(units: String!): Int!
}
```

```graphql {3} title="Subgraph B"
type Building @shareable {
  # ⚠️ Argument can't be omitted! ⚠️
  height: Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">⚠️</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql {3} title="Subgraph A"
type Building @shareable {
  # Argument is optional
  height(units: String): Int!
}
```

```graphql {5} title="Subgraph B"
type Building @shareable {
  # Argument can be omitted, BUT
  # it doesn't appear in the
  # supergraph schema!
  height: Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

For more information, see [Input types and field arguments](./composition#input-types-and-field-arguments).

### Omitting fields

Look at these two definitions of a `Position` object type:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">⚠️</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Subgraph A"
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

```graphql title="Subgraph B"
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  z: Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Subgraph B defines a `z` field, but Subgraph A doesn't. In this case, when composition generates the `Position` type for the supergraph schema, it includes all three fields:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Supergraph schema"
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  z: Int!
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

**This definition works for Subgraph B, but it presents a problem for Subgraph A.** Let's say Subgraph A defines the following `Query` type:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Subgraph A"
type Query {
  currentPosition: Position!
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

According to the hypothetical supergraph schema, the following query is valid against the supergraph:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">❌</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
query GetCurrentPosition {
  currentPosition {
    x
    y
    z # ⚠️ Unresolvable! ⚠️
  }
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

And here's the problem: if Subgraph B _doesn't_ define `Query.currentPosition`, this query _must_ be executed on Subgraph A. But Subgraph A is missing the `Position.z` field, so that field is **unresolvable**!

**Composition recognizes this potential problem, and it fails with an error.** So how do we fix it? Check out [Solutions for unresolvable fields](./composition/#solutions-for-unresolvable-fields).

## Adding new shared fields

Adding a new field to a value type can cause composition issues, because it's challenging to add the field to _all_ defining subgraphs at the same time.

Let's say we're adding a `z` field to our `Position` value type, and we start with Subgraph A:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">⚠️</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql {4} title="Subgraph A"
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  z: Int!
}
```

```graphql title="Subgraph B"
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

It's likely that when we attempt to compose these two schemas, composition will _fail_, because Subgraph B can't resolve `Position.z`.

To incrementally add the field to _all_ of our subgraphs _without_ breaking composition, we can use the [`@inaccessible` directive](#using-inaccessible).


### Using `@inaccessible`

If you apply the `@inaccessible` directive to a field, composition _omits_ that field from your router's API schema. This helps you incrementally add a field to multiple subgraphs without breaking composition.

To use `@inaccessible` in a subgraph, first make sure you include it in the `import` array of your Federation 2 opt-in declaration:

```graphql {3} title="Subgraph A"
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.3",
        import: ["@key", "@shareable", "@inaccessible"])
```

Then, whenever you add a new field to a value type, apply `@inaccessible` to that field if it isn't yet present in _every_ subgraph that defines the value type:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql {4} title="Subgraph A"
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  z: Int! @inaccessible
}
```

```graphql title="Subgraph B"
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

> Even if `Position.z` is defined in _multiple_ subgraphs, you only need to apply `@inaccessible` in _one_ subgraph to omit it. In fact, you might _want_ to apply it in only one subgraph to simplify removing it later.

With the syntax above, composition omits `Position.z` from the generated API schema, and the resulting `Position` type includes only `x` and `y` fields.

> Note that `Position.z` _does_ appear in the _supergraph_ schema, but the _API_ schema enforces which fields clients can include in operations. [Learn more about federated schemas.](./overview/)

Whenever you're ready, you can now add `Position.z` to Subgraph B:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Subgraph A"
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  z: Int! @inaccessible
}
```

```graphql {4} title="Subgraph B"
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  z: Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

At this point, `Position.z` is _still_ `@inaccessible`, so composition continues to ignore it.

Finally, when you've added `Position.z` to every subgraph that defines `Position`, you can remove `@inaccessible` from Subgraph A:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql {4} title="Subgraph A"
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  z: Int!
}
```

```graphql title="Subgraph B"
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  z: Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Composition now successfully includes `Position.z` in the supergraph schema!

## Unions and interfaces

In Federation 2, `union` and `interface` type definitions can be shared between subgraphs by default, _and_ those definitions can differ:
<CodeColumns>

```graphql {1, 3, 9} title="Subgraph A"
union Media = Book | Movie

interface User {
  name: String!
}
```

```graphql {1, 3, 9} title="Subgraph B"
union Media = Book | Podcast

interface User {
  name: String!
  age: Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

[Compositional logic](./composition#merging-types-from-multiple-subgraphs) merges these definitions in your supergraph schema:

```graphql title="Supergraph schema"
union Media = Book | Movie | Podcast

# The object types that implement this interface are
# responsible for resolving these fields.
interface User {
  name: String!
  age: Int!
}
```

This can be useful when different subgraphs are responsible for different subsets of a particular set of related types or values.

>  You can also use the `enum` type across multiple subgraphs. For details, see [Merging types from multiple subgraphs](composition#enums).

### Challenges with shared interfaces

Sharing an interface type across subgraphs introduces maintenance challenges whenever that interface changes. Consider these subgraphs:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Subgraph A"
interface Media {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}

type Book implements Media {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
```

```graphql title="Subgraph B"
interface Media {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}

type Podcast implements Media {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Now, let's say Subgraph B adds a `creator` field to the `Media` interface:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">❌</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Subgraph A"
interface Media {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}

type Book implements Media {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  # ❌ Doesn't define creator!
}
```

```graphql title="Subgraph B"
interface Media {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  creator: String! #highlight-line
}

type Podcast implements Media {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  creator: String! #highlight-line
}
```

</CodeColumns>

This breaks composition, because `Book` also implements `Media` but _doesn't_ define the new `creator` field.

To prevent this error, _all_ implementing types across _all_ subgraphs need to be updated to include all fields of `Media`. This becomes more and more challenging to do as your number of subgraphs and teams grows. Fortunately, there's a [solution](#solution-entity-interfaces).

#### Solution: Entity interfaces

Apollo Federation 2.3 introduces a powerful abstraction mechanism for interfaces, enabling you to add interface fields across subgraphs _without_ needing to update every single implementing type.

> [Learn more about entity interfaces.](./interfaces/)

## Input types

Subgraphs can share `input` type definitions, but composition merges their fields using an _intersection_ strategy. When `input` types are composed across multiple subgraphs, only _mutual_ fields are preserved in the supergraph schema:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Subgraph A"
input UserInput {
  name: String!
  age: Int # Not in Subgraph B
}
```

```graphql title="Subgraph B"
input UserInput {
  name: String!
  email: String # Not in Subgraph A
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Compositional logic merges only the fields that all `input` types have in common. To learn more, see [Merging input types and field arguments](./composition#input-types-and-field-arguments).

```graphql title="Supergraph schema"
input UserInput {
  name: String!
}
```

To learn more about how composition merges different schema types under the hood, see [Merging types during composition](./composition#merging-types-from-multiple-subgraphs).
