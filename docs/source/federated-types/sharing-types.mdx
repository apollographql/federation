In a federated graph, it's common to want to reuse a GraphQL type in multiple [subgraphs](../subgraphs/).

For example, suppose you want to define and reuse a generic `Position` type in different subgraphs:

```graphql
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

Types like this are called **value types**. This article describes how to share value types and their fields in federated graph, enabling multiple subgraphs to define and resolve them.

## Sharing object types

By default in [Federation 2 subgraphs](../federation-2/moving-to-federation-2/#phase-2-modify-subgraph-schemas), a single object field _can't_ be defined or resolved by more than one subgraph schema.

Consider the following `Position` example:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">❌</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{3-4}
# Subgraph A
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

```graphql{3-4}
# Subgraph B
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```
<></>

</CodeColumns>

Attempting to compose these two subgraph schemas together will [break composition](./composition/#breaking-composition). The gateway doesn't know _which subgraph_ is responsible for resolving `Position.x` and `Position.y`. To enable multiple subgraphs to resolve these fields, you must first mark that field as [`@shareable`](#using-shareable).

> As an alternative, if you want Subgraphs A and B to resolve _different_ fields of `Position`, you can designate the `Position` type as an [entity](../entities).

### Using `@shareable`

The `@shareable` directive enables multiple subgraphs to resolve a particular object field (or set of object fields).

To use `@shareable` in a subgraph schema, you first need to add the following snippet to that schema to [opt in to Federation 2](../federation-2/moving-to-federation-2/#opt-in-to-federation-2):

```graphql
extend schema
    @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0",
       import: ["@key", "@requires", "@shareable"])
```

Then you can apply the `@shareable` directive to an object type, or to _individual fields_ of that type:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">✅</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{2}
# Subgraph A
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

```graphql{3-4}
# Subgraph B
type Position {
  x: Int! @shareable
  y: Int! @shareable
}
```
<></>

</CodeColumns>

> Marking a type as `@shareable` is equivalent to marking _all_ of its fields as `@shareable`, so the two subgraph definitions above are equivalent.

Both subgraphs A _and_ B can now resolve the `x` and `y` fields for the `Position` type, and our subgraph schema will successfully compose into a supergraph schema.

#### ⚠️ Important considerations for `@shareable`

* If a type or field is marked `@shareable` in _any_ subgraph, it must be marked `@shareable` or [`@external`](../federation-spec/#external) in _every_ subgraph that defines it. Otherwise, composition fails.
* If multiple subgraphs can resolve a field, **make sure each subgraph's resolver for that field behaves identically.** Otherwise, queries might return inconsistent results depending on which subgraph resolves the field.

### Varying shared object fields

Shared fields can differ between subgraphs in specific ways:
* The return type of a shared field can vary in nullability (`String` / `String!`).
  * A shared field's return type _can't_ vary in its core type (`Int` vs. `String`) or in whether it returns a list (`Int` vs. `[Int]`).
* A shared field can be omitted from a subgraph entirely if that field is always [resolvable](../federated-types/composition/#rules-of-composition).

For example, take a look at the shared `Food` type below:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{4}
# Subgraph A
type Food @shareable {
  name: String!
  cost: Int!
}
```

```graphql{4,5}
# Subgraph B
type Food @shareable {
  name: String!
  cost: Int # Nullable
  inStock: Boolean! # Not in A
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

The above `Food` types differ in the nullability of their fields _and_ the fields included in each type.

#### Differing return types

Let's say two subgraphs both define an `Event` object type with a `timestamp` field:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">❌</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{3}
# Subgraph A
type Event @shareable {
  timestamp: Int!
}
```

```graphql{3}
# Subgraph B
type Event @shareable {
  timestamp: String!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Subgraph A's `timestamp` returns an `Int`, and Subgraph B's returns a `String`. **This is invalid.** When composition attempts to generate an `Event` type for the supergraph schema, it fails due to an unresolvable conflict between the two `timestamp` field definitions.

Next, look at these varying definitions for the `Position` object type:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">✅</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql{3,4}
# Subgraph A
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

```graphql{3,4}
# Subgraph B
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int
  y: Int
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

The `x` and `y` fields are _non-nullable_ in Subgraph A, but they're _nullable_ in Subgraph B. **This is valid!** Composition recognizes that it can use the following definition for `Position` in the supergraph schema:


```graphql
# Supergraph schema
type Position {
  x: Int
  y: Int
}
```

This definition works for querying Subgraph A, because Subgraph A's definition is _more restrictive_ than this (a non-nullable value is always valid for a nullable field). In this case, composition **coerces** Subgraph A's `Position` fields to satisfy the reduced restrictiveness of Subgraph B.

> Note that Subgraph A's actual subgraph schema is _not_ modified. Within Subgraph A, `x` and `y` remain non-nullable.

#### Omitting fields

Look at these two definitions of a `Position` object type:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">⚠️</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
}
```

```graphql
# Subgraph B
type Position @shareable {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  z: Int!
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

Subgraph B defines a `z` field, but Subgraph A doesn't. In this case, when composition generates the `Position` type for the supergraph schema, it includes all three fields:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Supergraph schema
type Position {
  x: Int!
  y: Int!
  z: Int!
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

**This definition works for Subgraph B, but it presents a problem for Subgraph A.** Let's say Subgraph A defines the following `Query` type:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
# Subgraph A
type Query {
  currentPosition: Position!
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

According to the hypothetical supergraph schema, the following query is valid against the supergraph:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">❌</p>

<CodeColumns>

```graphql
query GetCurrentPosition {
  currentPosition {
    x
    y
    z # ⚠️ Unresolvable! ⚠️
  }
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

And here's the problem: if Subgraph B _doesn't_ define `Query.currentPosition`, this query _must_ be executed on Subgraph A. But Subgraph A is missing the `Position.z` field, so that field is **unresolvable**!

**Composition recognizes this potential problem, and it fails with an error.** So how do we fix it? Check out [Solutions for unresolvable fields](./composition/#solutions-for-unresolvable-fields).


## Enums, unions, and interfaces

In Federation 2, `enum`, `interface`, and `union` type definitions can be shared between subgraphs by default, _and_ those definitions can differ:
<CodeColumns>

```graphql{2, 4, 10}
# Subgraph A
union Media = Book | Movie

enum Color {
  RED
  GREEN
  BLUE
}

interface User {
  name: String!
}
```

```graphql{2, 4, 10}
# Subgraph B
union Media = Book | Podcast

enum Color {
  CYAN
  MAGENTA
  YELLOW
}

interface User {
  name: String!
  age: Int!
}
```

<></>

</CodeColumns>

Compositional logic merges these definitions in your supergraph schema:

```graphql
# Supergraph schema
union Media = Book | Movie | Podcast

enum Color {
  RED
  GREEN
  BLUE
  CYAN
  MAGENTA
  YELLOW
}

# The object types that implement this interface are
# responsible for resolving these fields.
interface User {
  name: String!
  age: Int!
}
```

This can be useful when different subgraphs are responsible for different subsets of a particular set of related types or values.
