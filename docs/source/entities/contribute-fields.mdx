---

In a federated GraphQL architecture, individual subgraphs can contribute to and reference fields from shared entities.
This guide explains how subgraphs work together to build a cohesive schema, with examples of contributing and computing entity fields, as well as referencing entities without contributing fields.

## Contributing entity fields

Any number of different subgraphs can contribute fields to an entity definition.
In the example below, the Products and Inventory subgraphs contribute different fields to the `Product` entity:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Products subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Int
}
```

```graphql title="Inventory subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  inStock: Boolean!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

By default, each subgraph must contribute different fields, with the important exception of `@key` fields.
If multiple subgraphs attempt to contribute the same field, a composition error occurs.
To override this default behavior, see [Resolving another subgraph's field](/graphos/schema-design/federated-schemas/entities/resolve-another-subgraphs-fields).

Each subgraph that contributes fields to an entity must [define a reference resolver](/graphos/get-started/guides/federate-schemas/#2-define-a-reference-resolver) for that entity.

## Contributing computed entity fields

You can define entity fields that are computed from values of other entity fields, even when a different subgraph resolves those fields.

For example, this Shipping subgraph adds a `shippingEstimate` field to the `Product` entity.
This field is calculated based on the product's `size` and `weight`, which the Products subgraph defines:

```graphql {3-5} title="Shipping subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  size: Int @external
  weight: Int @external
  shippingEstimate: String @requires(fields: "size weight")
}
```

```graphql title="Products subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Int
  size: Int
  weight: Int
}
```


Notice the Shipping subgraph uses two directives:

- The `@requires` directive indicates which fields are required from other subgraphs.
- The `@external` directives is applied to required fields in the type definition.
  - This directive tells the router, "This subgraph knows these fields exist, but it can't resolve them itself."

### How the router processes computed entity fields

In the previous example, if a query requests a product's `shippingEstimate`, the router does the following:

1. It queries the Products subgraph for the product's `size` and `weight`.
2. It queries the Shipping subgraph for the product's `shippingEstimate`.
  - It includes the `size` and `weight` of the `Product` object passed to the resolver for `shippingEstimate`:

  ```js {4} title="resolvers.js"
  {
    Product: {
      shippingEstimate(product) {
        return computeShippingEstimate(product.id, product.size, product.weight);
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Using `@requires` with object subfields

If a computed field `@requires` a field that returns an object type, you also specify which subfields of that object are required.
You list those subfields with the following syntax:

```graphql {3-4} title="Shipping subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  dimensions: ProductDimensions @external
  shippingEstimate: String @requires(fields: "dimensions { size weight }")
}
```

In this modification of the previous example, `size` and `weight` are now subfields of a `ProductDimensions` object.
The Products and Shipping subgraphs must both define the `ProductDimensions` type for this to be valid.

<MinVersion version="2.1.2">

### Using `@requires` with fields that take arguments

</MinVersion>

Starting in Federation v2.1.2, the `@requires` directive can include fields that take arguments, like so:

```graphql title="Shipping subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  weight(units: String): Int @external
  #highlight-start
  shippingEstimate: String @requires(fields: "weight(units:\"KILOGRAMS\")")
  #highlight-end
}
```

The following rules apply:

- The router provides the specified values in its query to whichever subgraph defines the required field.
- Each specified argument value is static; the router always provides the same value.
- You can omit values for nullable arguments. You must provide values for non-nullable arguments.
- If you define your subgraph schema in an SDL file instead of programmatically, you must escape quotes for string and enum values with backslashes (as shown above).

## Referencing an entity without contributing fields

Your subgraphs can use an entity as a field's return type without contributing any fields to that entity.

For example, take a look at this `Product` entity in the Products subgraph:

```graphql title="Products subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Int
}
```

Suppose you want to create a Reviews subgraph that includes the following `Review` type:

```graphql {2} title="Reviews subgraph"
type Review {
  product: Product!
  score: Int!
}
```

While this is possible, the current Reviews subgraph schema is invalid because it doesn't define the `Product` entity.

To fix this, add a _stub_ of the `Product` entity to the Reviews schema, like so:

```graphql {6-8} title="Reviews subgraph"
type Review {
  product: Product!
  score: Int!
}

type Product @key(fields: "id", resolvable: false) {
  id: ID!
}
```

A stub definition includes only the `@key` fields of an entity.
In this case, the `Product` type definition only includes the `id` field.
It also includes `resolvable: false` in the `@key` directive to indicate that this subgraph doesn't define a reference resolver for the `Product` entity.
