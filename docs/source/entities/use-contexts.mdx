<EnterpriseFeature>

The `@context` and `@fromContext` directives are [Enterprise features](/router/enterprise-features) of the Apollo Router and require an organization with a [GraphOS Enterprise plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/). If your organization doesn't have an Enterprise plan, you can test it out by signing up for a free [Enterprise trial](/graphos/org/plans/#enterprise-trials).

In an entity, a nested object may have a dependency on an ancestor type and thus need access to that ancestor's field(s).

To enable a descendant to access an ancestor's field, you could add it as a `@key` field to every entity along the chain of nested types, but that can become problematic. Deeply nested types can change the `@key` fields of many entities. The added field may be irrelevant to the entities it's added to. Most importantly, overloading `@key` fields often breaks the separation of concerns between different subgraphs.

The `@context` and `@fromContext` directives enable a subgraph to share fields without overloading `@key` fields. You can use these directives to define one or more _contexts_ in a subgraph. Contexts provide a way for a subgraph to share data between types of a nested-type hierarchy without overloading entity keys with extraneous fields. Contexts also preserve the separation of concerns between different subgraphs.

## Using one context

As an example of a single context, the subgraph below tracks the last financial transaction made per user. The `Transaction` type is a child of the `User` type. Each transaction depends on the associated user's currency to calculate the transaction amount in the user's currency. That dependency—the `currencyCode` argument of a `Transaction` depending on the `userCurrency { isoCode } ` of a `User`— is defined with a context. The `@context` directive on `User` sets the context, and `@fromContext` on `currencyCode` gets the contextual data.  

```graphql title="Example: using @context and @fromContext"
scalar CurrencyCode;

type Currency {
   id: ID!
   isoCode: CurrencyCode!
}

type User @key(fields: "id") @context(name: "userContext") {
   id: ID!
   lastTransaction: Transaction!
   userCurrency: Currency!
}

type Transaction @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  currency: Currency!
  amount: Int!
  amountInUserCurrency(
    currencyCode: CurrencyCode
        @fromContext(field: "$userContext { userCurrency { isoCode } }")
  ): Int!
}
```

<Note>

An argument of `@fromContext` doesn't appear in the API schema. Instead, it's populated automatically by the router.

In the example above, the argument `currencyCode: CurrencyCode!` wouldn't appear in the API schema.

</Note>

## Using type conditions in @fromContext 

In this example, note how the `@fromContext` directive uses a series of type condition to select the desired field when accessing `Child.prop1`. A type condition is not required if all possible contexts have a field present as is the case for `Child.prop2`.

```graphql title="Example: using multiple contexts"
type Query {
  a: A!
  b: B!
  c: C!
}

type A @key(fields: "id") @context(name: "context_1"){
  id: ID!
  field: String!
  someField: String!
  child: Child!
} 

type B @key(fields: "id") @context(name: "context_1"){
  id: ID!
  field: String!
  someField: String!
  child: Child!
} 

type C @key(fields: "id") @context(name: "context_1") {
  id: ID!
  field: String!
  someOtherField: String!
  child: Child!
} 

type Child @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  prop1(
    arg: String! 
        @fromContext(field: "$context_1 ... on A { someField } ... on B { someField } ... on C { someOtherField }")
  ): Int!
  prop2(
    arg: String! 
        @fromContext(field: "$context_1 { field }")
  ): Int!
}
```

When the same contextual value is set in multiple places—as in the example with the `Child.prop1` and `Child.prop2` `args`—the `FieldValue` must resolve all types from each place into a single value that matches the parameter type.

<Note>

Federation doesn't guarantee which context will be used if a field is reachable via multiple contexts.

</Note>

## Disambiguating contexts

When multiple ancestor entities in the type hierarchy could fulfill a set context, the nearest ancestor is chosen. For example, if both the parent and grandparent of a type can provide the value of a context, the parent is chosen because it's the closer ancestor.

In the following example, given nested types `A`, `B`, and `C`, with `C` referencing a context that either `A` or `B` could provide, `C` uses the value from `B` because it's a closer ancestor to `C` than `A`:

```graphql
type Query { 
  a: A!
}

type A @key(fields: "id") @context(name: "context_1") {
  id: ID!
  field: String!
  b: B!
} 

type B @key(fields: "id") @context(name: "context_1") {
  id: ID!
  field: String!
  c: C!
} 

type C @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  prop(
    arg: String! @fromContext(field: "$context_1 { field }")
  ): Int!
} 
```

In a more complex graph, a field could be reachable via multiple paths, and a different field could be used to resolve the `prop` depending on which path was used.

## Referencing fields across subgraphs

The definition of context scopes can only exist in one subgraph schema. The `@fromContext` directive can't reference a `@context` defined in another subgraph. However, you can use contexts to share data across subgraphs using the `@external` reference.

Reusing the [`Transaction` example](#using-one-context), imagine a subgraph responsible for the `User` and `Currency` types:

```graphql
scalar CurrencyCode

type Currency @shareable {
   id: ID!
   isoCode: CurrencyCode!
}

type User @key(fields: "id") {
   id: ID!
   userCurrency: Currency!
}
```

If you want to reference those fields from another subgraph, you can use the `@external` directive to pass data across subgraph boundaries:

```graphql
scalar CurrencyCode

type Currency @shareable {
   id: ID!
   isoCode: CurrencyCode!
}

type User @key(fields: "id") @context(name: "userContext") {
   id: ID!
   
  # This is a reference to the field resolved elsewhere
   userCurrency: Currency! @external
   
   # We add this field to our type here
   lastTransaction: Transaction! 
}

type Transaction @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  currency: Currency!
  amount: Int!
  amountInUserCurrency(
    currencyCode: CurrencyCode 
        @fromContext(field: "$userContext { userCurrency { isoCode } }")
  ): Int!
}
```
