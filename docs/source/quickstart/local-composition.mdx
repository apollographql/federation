title: Federation quickstart
description: Part 3 - Local schema composition
---

[Back in Part 2](./studio-composition/), we used managed federation with Apollo Studio to compose our gateway's supergraph schema. Next, let's try out composing _locally_ with the Rover CLI.

## 1. Provide subgraph details

Like Apollo Studio, the Rover CLI needs the following information about each of our subgraphs to compose them:

* The subgraph's schema
* The URL of the subgraph's GraphQL endpoint (which must be accessible by the gateway)

To provide these details to Rover, we define a YAML configuration file.

In your project directory, create a file called `supergraph-config.yaml` and paste the following into it:

```yaml title="supergraph-config.yaml"
federation_version: 2 # Without this line, Rover uses Federation 1
subgraphs:
  products:
    routing_url: https://rover.apollo.dev/quickstart/products/graphql
    schema:
      subgraph_url: https://rover.apollo.dev/quickstart/products/graphql
  reviews:
    routing_url: https://rover.apollo.dev/quickstart/reviews/graphql
    schema:
      subgraph_url: https://rover.apollo.dev/quickstart/reviews/graphql
```

As you can see, we're providing the same URL as the value of two different fields. These fields serve different purposes:

* `routing_url` is the URL the _gateway_ will use to send GraphQL operations to the subgraph at runtime.
* `schema.subgraph_url` is the URL that _Rover_ will use to fetch the subgraph schema during composition.

These URLs might theoretically differ. The YAML file also supports providing a subgraph's schema as a local file path, or as a registered graph ref that Rover can fetch from Apollo (for details, [see the Rover docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/supergraphs/#composing-a-supergraph-schema)).

## 2. Perform composition

Now that our configuration file is ready, we can compose our supergraph schema. To do that, we'll use Rover's `supergraph compose` command.

> [Haven't installed the latest version of Rover?](./setup/#1-install-the-rover-cli)

From your project directory, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
rover supergraph compose --config ./supergraph-config.yaml
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** The first time you run this command with a Federation 2 YAML configuration, Rover installs a separate plugin and prompts you to accept the terms and conditions of the ELv2 license.
>
> To automatically accept this prompt (especially important for CI environments), set `APOLLO_ELV2_LICENSE=accept`.
>
> [Learn more.](/resources/elastic-license-v2-faq/)

Rover outputs the following schema:

```

As you can see, this composed schema includes all of the types and fields from our subgraph schemas, along with many additional directives that the gateway uses to support our federated architecture.

Now, append ` > supergraph.graphql` to the above command to write the composed schema to a file:

```shell
rover supergraph compose --config ./supergraph-config.yaml > supergraph.graphql
```

## 3. Update the gateway

When we provide a _Rover-composed_ supergraph schema to our gateway, we pass it as an option to the constructor of `ApolloGateway`, instead of providing it as an environment variable.

Open your `index.js` file and replace its contents with the following:

```js title="index.js"
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { ApolloGateway } = require('@apollo/gateway');
const { readFileSync } = require('fs');

const supergraphSdl = readFileSync('./supergraph.graphql').toString();

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  supergraphSdl
});

const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway,
  // Subscriptions are not currently supported in Apollo Federation
  subscriptions: false
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`🚀 Gateway ready at ${url}`);
}).catch(err => {console.error(err)});
```

If you run this code with `node index.js`, the gateway reads your static supergraph schema from a file. This does _not_ communicate with Apollo Studio, which means it's well suited to local development or CI environments that don't want to introduce an external dependency.

Great job! We've seen how to compose our supergraph schema with both managed federation and the Rover CLI. Next, let's look at how to apply what we've learned to our own subgraphs. [Go to part 4.](./local-subgraphs/)
