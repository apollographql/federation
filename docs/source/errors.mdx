title: Federation Error Codes
description: Learn the error codes you can receive if composition fails.
toc: false
---

When Apollo Gateway attempts to compose the schemas provided by your [subgraphs](./building-supergraphs/subgraphs-overview/) into a supergraph schema, it confirms that:

- The subgraphs are valid
- The resulting supergraph schema is valid
- The gateway has all of the information it needs to execute operations against the resulting schema

If Apollo Gateway encounters an error, composition fails. This document lists subgraph validation and composition error codes, along with their root causes.

### Errors

The following errors might be raised during composition:
