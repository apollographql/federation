Subgraph-compatible server libraries automatically add some federation-specific definitions to your subgraph schema. In addition to directive definitions like `@key`, the most useful of these definitions for debugging are two fields of the `Query` type: `_service` and `_entities`:

```graphql
type Query {
  # ...your field definitions...

  # Added automatically
  _service: _Service!
  _entities(representations: [_Any!]!): [_Entity]!
}
```

## `Query._entities`

<Tip>

[Learn about entities](/graphos/get-started/guides/federate-schemas#entity-overview) if you haven't yet.

</Tip>

This field takes a list of _entity representations_ and returns a list of corresponding entities.

Whenever one subgraph references another subgraph's entity, it uses an entity representation to do so. An entity representation is an object that includes only the entity's `__typename` and the fields in the entity's `@key`.

```graphql
_entities(representations: [_Any!]!): [_Entity]!
```

- The `_Any` type is a special scalar that enables you to provide entity representations of any valid shape.
- The `_Entity` type is a generated [union type](/apollo-server/schema/unions-interfaces/#union-type) that includes every entity defined in your subgraph's schema.

You can query this field like so, providing a value for the `$representations` variable as shown:

```graphql title="Query"
query ($representations: [_Any!]!) {
  _entities(representations: $representations) {
    ... on User {
      id
      username
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="Variable"
{
  "representations": [
    {
      "__typename": "User",
      "id": "5"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Using in tests and debugging

If you're writing integration tests for your subgraph, you can test the return value of the `_entities` field for various entity representations that your other subgraphs use.

If you're developing your subgraph in your local environment, you can [mock the return value](/apollo-server/testing/mocking/) of the `_entities` field for your other subgraphs so you don't have to connect those subgraphs to their respective data stores.


## `Query._service`

This field returns a `_Service` object with one field of its own: `sdl`. You can query it like so:

```graphql
query GetSubgraphSchema {
  _service {
    sdl
  }
}
```

The `sdl` field returns your subgraph's schema as an SDL string. This field has a couple of important differences from a standard [introspection query](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) that a tool like Apollo Sandbox uses:

- Unlike introspection, the `sdl` field is not disabled by default in production environments (this is safe if you properly [secure your subgraph](#securing-your-subgraphs)).
- Unlike introspection, the `sdl` field's returned string includes federation-specific directives like `@key`.
