title: Apollo Federation Error Codes
subtitle: Reference for composition error codes
description: Reference the error codes encountered during Apollo Federation schema composition, identifying root causes and solutions for GraphQL debugging.
toc: false
---

When GraphOS attempts to compose your subgraph schemas into a supergraph schema, it confirms that:

- The subgraphs have valid GraphQL and Federation syntax
- The resulting supergraph schema is valid
- The graph router or gateway has all of the information it needs to execute operations against the resulting schema

If composition fails, a new supergraph schema cannot be generated. This document lists subgraph validation and composition error codes, along with their root causes.

<Note>

Composition may flag potential improvements or _hints_ on schemas which are technically valid. These hints aren't  errors, and are instead logged as part of the composition build step.
To learn more, see the [composition hints doc](/federation/hints/).

## Errors

The following errors might be raised during composition:

As there is no type ownership anymore, there is also no particular limitation as to where a field can be external.

###### `INTERFACE_FIELD_IMPLEM_TYPE_MISMATCH`

</td>
<td>

This error was thrown by a validation introduced to avoid running into a known runtime bug. Since Federation v2.3, the underlying runtime bug has been addressed and the validation/limitation was no longer necessary and has been removed.

###### `KEY_FIELDS_MISSING_EXTERNAL`

</td>
<td>

Using `@external` for key fields is now discouraged, unless the field is truly meant to be external.

###### `KEY_FIELDS_MISSING_ON_BASE`

Keys can now use any field from any other subgraph.

###### `KEY_MISSING_ON_BASE`

</td>

Each subgraph is now free to declare a key only if it needs it.

</td>

###### `KEY_NOT_SPECIFIED`

</td>
<td>

Each subgraph can declare a key independently of any other subgraph.

###### `MULTIPLE_KEYS_ON_EXTENSION`

</td>

Every subgraph can have multiple keys, as necessary.

###### `NON_REPEATABLE_DIRECTIVE_ARGUMENTS_MISMATCH`

</td>
<td>

Since Federation v2.1.0, the case this error used to cover is now a warning (with code `INCONSISTENT_NON_REPEATABLE_DIRECTIVE_ARGUMENTS`) instead of an error.

###### `PROVIDES_FIELDS_SELECT_INVALID_TYPE`

</td>

`@provides` can now be used on fields of interface, union, and list types.

`@provides` can now be used on any type.

Since Federation v2.1.1, using fields with arguments in a `@requires` is fully supported.

Fields in `@requires` can now be from any subgraph.

As there is no type ownership anymore, there is also no particular limitation as to which subgraph can use a `@requires`.

###### `RESERVED_FIELD_USED`

</td>
<td>

This error was previously not correctly enforced: the service and entities, if present, were overridden; this is still the case.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

###### `VALUE_TYPE_NO_ENTITY`

</td>
<td>

There is no strong difference between entity and value types in the model (they are just usage patterns), and a type can have keys in one subgraph but not another.

###### `VALUE_TYPE_UNION_TYPES_MISMATCH`

</td>

Subgraph definitions for a union are now merged by composition.
