title: Apollo Federation Error Codes
subtitle: Reference for composition error codes
description: Reference the error codes encountered during Apollo Federation schema composition, identifying root causes and solutions for GraphQL debugging.
toc: false
---

When GraphOS attempts to compose your subgraph schemas into a supergraph schema, it confirms that:

- The subgraphs have valid GraphQL and Federation syntax
- The resulting supergraph schema is valid
- The graph router or gateway has all of the information it needs to execute operations against the resulting schema

If composition fails, a new supergraph schema cannot be generated. This document lists subgraph validation and composition error codes, along with their root causes.

<Note>

Composition may flag potential improvements or _hints_ on schemas which are technically valid. These hints aren't  errors, and are instead logged as part of the composition build step.
To learn more, see the [composition hints doc](/federation/hints/).

## Errors

The following errors might be raised during composition:

###### `KEY_NOT_SPECIFIED`

</td>
<td>

Each subgraph can declare a key independently of any other subgraph.

</td>

<tr>
<td>

###### `MULTIPLE_KEYS_ON_EXTENSION`

</td>
<td>

Every subgraph can have multiple keys, as necessary.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

###### `NON_REPEATABLE_DIRECTIVE_ARGUMENTS_MISMATCH`

Since Federation v2.1.0, the case this error used to cover is now a warning (with code `INCONSISTENT_NON_REPEATABLE_DIRECTIVE_ARGUMENTS`) instead of an error.

</td>

<td>

###### `PROVIDES_FIELDS_SELECT_INVALID_TYPE`

</td>
<td>

`@provides` can now be used on fields of interface, union, and list types.

</td>

</td>
<td>

`@provides` can now be used on any type.

</td>

This error was previously not correctly enforced: the service and entities, if present, were overridden; this is still the case.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

###### `VALUE_TYPE_NO_ENTITY`

</td>

There is no strong difference between entity and value types in the model (they are just usage patterns), and a type can have keys in one subgraph but not another.

###### `VALUE_TYPE_UNION_TYPES_MISMATCH`

</td>
<td>

Subgraph definitions for a union are now merged by composition.
