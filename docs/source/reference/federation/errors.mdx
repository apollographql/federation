title: Apollo Federation Error Codes
subtitle: Reference for composition error codes
description: Reference the error codes encountered during Apollo Federation schema composition, identifying root causes and solutions for GraphQL debugging.
toc: false
---

When GraphOS attempts to compose your subgraph schemas into a supergraph schema, it confirms that:

- The subgraphs have valid GraphQL and Federation syntax
- The resulting supergraph schema is valid
- The graph router or gateway has all of the information it needs to execute operations against the resulting schema

If composition fails, a new supergraph schema cannot be generated. This document lists subgraph validation and composition error codes, along with their root causes.

<Note>

Composition may flag potential improvements or _hints_ on schemas which are technically valid. These hints aren't  errors, and are instead logged as part of the composition build step.
To learn more, see the [composition hints doc](/federation/hints/).

### Errors
