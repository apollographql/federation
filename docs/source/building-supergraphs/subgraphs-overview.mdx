title: Subgraphs
description: In a federated supergraph
---

Every federated supergraph includes one or more **subgraphs**. Each subgraph is a separate GraphQL service that's responsible for a different portion of your supergraph's available data.

Here's a basic supergraph that includes two subgraphs (Users and Products):

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Supergraph";
  gateway([Router]);
  serviceA[Users<br/>subgraph];
  serviceB[Products<br/>subgraph];
  gateway --- serviceA & serviceB;
  end;
  clients -.- gateway;
  class clients secondary;
```

You can implement different subgraphs using completely different programming languages and GraphQL server libraries!

## Choosing a subgraph library

Every subgraph in your supergraph should use a **subgraph-compatible GraphQL server library**. These are libraries that adhere to the Apollo Federation subgraph specification, which ensures that your supergraph can take full advantage of federation features like [entities](../entities/).

[See federation-compatible subgraph libraries.](./supported-subgraphs/)

After you select a subgraph library, consult its documentation to learn how to configure it to run as a subgraph.

> If you're using Apollo Server as your subgraph library, see [Implementing a subgraph with Apollo Server](./subgraphs-apollo-server/).

## Securing your subgraphs

Implement any necessary firewall rules, access control lists, or other security measures in your environment to ensure that **only your supergraph's router** can access your individual subgraphs.

**Clients should never query a subgraph directly!** Instead, clients should always query your router, which resolves those queries by communicating with your subgraphs.

There are many reasons for this:

- Subgraph libraries automatically add [powerful fields](#subgraph-specific-fields) to your schema that clients _should not_ have access to.
  - The router uses these fields to cross subgraph boundaries while resolving complex operations.
- Providing a single endpoint for your entire supergraph reduces its overall [attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface).

> In addition to the above security concerns, a significant benefit of _any_ GraphQL API is that clients only need to interact with one endpoint. This definitely holds true for a supergraph, especially one with tens or even hundreds of subgraphs! 

### Disabling CORS

We recommend that subgraphs do not enable CORS (or at least, do not use the wildcard `access-control-allow-origin: *` header). This prevents attackers from exploiting a user's browser to access a subgraph directly.

For Apollo Server subgraphs, you need to disable the default wildcard CORS policy (which is appropriate for many publicly-exposed servers but not for inaccessible servers like subgraphs). For details, see the [Apollo Server CORS documentation](/apollo-server/security/cors/#choosing-cors-options-for-your-project).

## Subgraph-specific fields

When you [generate your subgraph schema](#4-generate-the-subgraph-schema), some federation-specific definitions are automatically added to it. In addition to directive definitions like `@key`, the most useful of these definitions for debugging are two fields of the `Query` type: `_service` and `_entities`:

```graphql
type Query {
  # ...your field definitions...

  # Added automatically
  _service: _Service!
  _entities(representations: [_Any!]!): [_Entity]!
}
```

### `Query._service`

This field returns a `_Service` object with one field of its own: `sdl`. You can query it like so:

```graphql
query GetSubgraphSchema {
  _service {
    sdl
  }
}
```

The `sdl` field returns your subgraph's schema as an SDL string. This field has a couple of important differences from a standard [introspection query](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) that a tool like Apollo Sandbox uses:

* Unlike introspection, the `sdl` field is _not_ disabled by default in production environments (this is safe if you properly [secure your subgraph](#securing-your-subgraphs)).
* Unlike introspection, the `sdl` field's returned string includes federation-specific directives like `@key`.

### `Query._entities`

> [Learn about entities](../entities/) if you haven't yet.

This field takes a list of **entity representations** and returns a list of corresponding entities.

> Whenever one subgraph references _another_ subgraph's entity, it uses an **entity representation** to do so. An entity representation is an object that includes _only_ the entity's `__typename` and the fields in the entity's `@key`.

```graphql
_entities(representations: [_Any!]!): [_Entity]!
```

* The `_Any` type is a special scalar that enables you to provide entity representations of any valid shape.
* The `_Entity` type is a generated [union type](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/unions-interfaces/#union-type) that includes every entity defined in your subgraph's schema.

You can query this field like so, providing a value for the `$representations` variable as shown:

```graphql title="Query"
query ($representations: [_Any!]!) {
  _entities(representations: $representations) {
    ... on User {
      id
      username
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="Variable"
{
  "representations": [
    {
      "__typename": "User",
      "id": "5"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Using in tests and debugging

If you're writing integration tests for your subgraph, you can test the return value of the `_entities` field for various entity representations that your _other_ subgraphs use.

If you're developing your subgraph in your local environment, you can [mock the return value](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/testing/mocking/) of the `_entities` field for your _other_ subgraphs so you don't have to connect those subgraphs to their respective data stores.
