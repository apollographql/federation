title: The router
description: The entry point to your supergraph
---

After you set up at least one federation-ready [subgraph](./subgraphs-overview/), you can configure a router to sit in front of your subgraphs. The router serves as the entry point to your supergraph, and it executes incoming operations across one or more of your subgraphs:

```mermaid
graph LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Supergraph";
  gateway([Router]);
  serviceA[Users<br/>subgraph];
  serviceB[Products<br/>subgraph];
  gateway --- serviceA & serviceB;
  end;
  clients -.- gateway;
  class clients secondary;
```

## Choosing a router library

Apollo actively supports the following options for your router:

- **The Apollo Router (recommended)**: This is a high-performance, precompiled Rust binary.

    - If you're getting started with federation, we recommend [creating a cloud supergraph](/graphos/quickstart/cloud/) with Apollo GraphOS. With a cloud supergraph, GraphOS provisions and manages your router for you.
    - You can also host your own Apollo Router instances. [See the federation quickstart](../quickstart/setup/) to get started.

- **Apollo Server**: Apollo Server can act as your router via the [`@apollo/gateway`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/gateway) extension library.
    - [See how to set up Apollo Gateway](/apollo-server/using-federation/apollo-gateway-setup).

<Tip>

Apollo recommends starting with the Apollo Router. It's faster to configure, performant even under high request loads, and supports many enterprise features.

<ExpansionPanel title="When should I use Apollo Server?">

You might need to use Apollo Server for your router if your subgraphs use a custom authentication method that it's currently difficult to configure with the Apollo Router. Note that teams unfamiliar with Rust can still customize the Apollo Router's behavior using the [Rhai scripting language](/router/customizations/rhai).

Regardless of which library you start with, you can swap to the other without making any changes to other parts of your supergraph.

If you'll use the Apollo Router, get started with the resources linked above. If you'll use Apollo Server, see [Setting up Apollo Gateway](/apollo-server/using-federation/apollo-gateway-setup).
