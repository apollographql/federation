After you set up at least one federation-ready [subgraph](./subgraphs-overview/), you can configure a **graph router** (also known as a gateway) to sit in front of your subgraphs. The router serves as the entry point to your supergraph, and it executes incoming operations across one or more of your subgraphs:

<FederationArchitecture />

## Choosing a router library

Apollo actively supports the following options for your graph router:

- **The Apollo Router (recommended):** This is a high-performance, precompiled Rust binary.

    If you're getting started with federation, we recommend [creating a **cloud supergraph**](/studio/getting-started) with Apollo GraphOS. With a cloud supergraph, GraphOS provisions and manages Apollo Router instances for you!

    You can also host your own Apollo Router instances:

    - [Go to the Apollo Router docs.](/router/quickstart/)
    - [See the federation quickstart](../quickstart/setup/) (which uses the Apollo Router).
- **Apollo Server:** Apollo Server can act as your graph router via the [`@apollo/gateway`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/gateway) extension library.

**We recommend starting with the Apollo Router.** It's faster to configure, it's more performant (especially with high request loads), and it rarely requires writing custom code.

<ExpansionPanel title="When should I use Apollo Server?">

You might need to use Apollo Server for your graph router if your subgraphs use a custom authentication method that it's currently difficult to configure with the Apollo Router. Note that teams unfamiliar with Rust can still customize the Apollo Router's behavior using the [Rhai scripting language](/router/customizations/rhai).

Regardless of which graph router library you start with, you can swap to the other without making any changes to other parts of your supergraph.

**If you'll use the Apollo Router,** get started with the resources linked above. If you'll use Apollo Server, see [Setting up Apollo Gateway](/apollo-server/using-federation/apollo-gateway-setup).
