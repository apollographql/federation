description: Learn how to configure a router to act as the gateway to your subgraphs, facilitating seamless execution of operations across multiple services. Efficiently manage and orchestrate your federated supergraph with a robust router setup.
---

After you set up at least one federation-ready subgraph, you can configure a router to sit in front of your subgraphs. The router serves as the entry point to your supergraph, and it executes incoming operations across one or more of your subgraphs:

```mermaid
graph LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Supergraph";
  gateway([Router]);
  serviceA[Users<br/>subgraph];
  serviceB[Products<br/>subgraph];
  gateway --- serviceA & serviceB;
  end;
  clients -.- gateway;
  class clients secondary;
```

## Choosing a router library

Apollo actively supports the following options for your router:

- **The GraphOS Router (recommended)**: This is a high-performance, precompiled Rust binary based on the Apollo Router Core.

    - If you're getting started with federation, we recommend [creating a cloud supergraph](/graphos/quickstart/cloud/) with Apollo GraphOS. With a cloud supergraph, GraphOS provisions and manages your router for you.
    - You can also host your own GraphOS Router instances. [See the Federation Quickstart](../quickstart/setup/) to get started.

- **Apollo Server**: Apollo Server can act as your router via the [`@apollo/gateway`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/gateway) extension library.
    - [See how to set up Apollo Gateway](/apollo-server/using-federation/apollo-gateway-setup).

<Tip>

Apollo recommends starting with the GraphOS Router. It's faster to configure, performant even under high request loads, and supports many enterprise features.

</Tip>

If you'll use the GraphOS Router, get started with the resources linked above. If you'll use Apollo Server, see [Setting up Apollo Gateway](/apollo-server/using-federation/apollo-gateway-setup).
