/**
 * An immutable directed graph data structure (built of vertices and edges) that is layered over one or multiple
 * graphQL schema, that aims to facilitate reasoning about queries expressed on the underlying schema.
 *
 * On top of its set of vertices and edges, a query graph exposes:
 *  - its set of "sources": pointers to the graphQL schema on which the query graph was built.
 *  - a set of distinguished vertices called "root" vertices. A query graph has at most one root
 *    vertex per `SchemaRootKind`, and those vertices are usually entry points for traversals of
 *    a query graph.
 *
 * In practice, the code builds 2 "kind" of query graphs:
 *  1. a supergraph query graph, which is built on top of a supergraph API schema (@see buildGraph()),
 *     and is built to reason about user queries (made on the supergraph API). This supergraph query
 *     graph is used to validate composition.
 *  2. a "federated" query graph, which is a single graph built on top of a) a number of subgraph
 *    API schema and b) the additional federation directives on those subgraphs (@see buildFederatedQueryGraph()).
 *    This query graph is used both for validating composition and for query planning.
 *
 * Note that this class handles both cases, but a "supergraph query graph" will, by construction, have
 * a few more invariants than a "federated query graph". Including (but not necessarily limited to):
 *  - edges in a super graph query graph will never have `conditions` or 'key' edges (edges with a `KeyResolution` edges).
 *  - supergraph query graphs will have a single value in `sources` (the supergraph schema).
 *
 * Also note that as query graphs are about reasoning about queries over schema, they only contain vertices
 * that points to "reachable" types (reachable from any kind of operations).
 */

   * Given an edge, returns the possible edges that can follow it "productively", that is without creating
   * a trivially inefficient path.
   *
   * More precisely, `nonTrivialFollowupEdges(e)` is equivalent calling `outEdges(e.tail)` and filtering
   * the edges that "never make sense" after `e`, which mainly amounts to avoiding chaining key edges
   * when we know there is guaranteed to be a better option. As an example, suppose we have 3 subgraphs
   * A, B and C which all defined a `@key(fields: "id")` on some entity type `T`. Then it is never
   * interesting to take that key edge from B -> C after A -> B because if we're in A and want to get
   * to C, we can always do A -> C (of course, this is only true because it's the "same" key).
   *
   * See `preComputeNonTrivialFollowupEdges` for more details on which exact edges are filtered.
   *
   * Lastly, note that the main reason for exposing this method is that its result is pre-computed.
   * Which in turn is done for performance reasons: having the same key defined in multiple subgraphs
   * is _the_ most common pattern, and while our later algorithms (composition validation and query
   * planning) would know to not select those trivially inefficient "detour", they might have to redo
   * those checks many times and pre-computing once it is significantly faster (and pretty easy).
   * Fwiw, when originally introduced, this optimization lowered composition validation on a big
   * composition (100+ subgraphs) from ~4 "minutes" to ~10 seconds.

   * We've added edges that avoid type-explosion _directly_ from an interface, but it means that so far we

   *  u: U

   * type B implements I1 & I2 {
   *   x: Int
   *   y: Int
   * }

   * the we currently have no edge between `U` and `I1` whatsoever, so query planning would have
   * to type-explode `U` even though that's not necessary (assuming everything is in the same
   * subgraph, we'd want to send the query "as-is").

   * {
   *   i1 {
   *     x
   *     ... on U2 {
   *       y
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * due to not having edges from `I1` to `I2` (granted, in that example, type-exploding is not all
   * that worth, but it gets worth with more implementations/fields).
   *
   * And so this method is about adding such edges. Essentially, every time 2 abstract types have
   * an intersection of runtime types > 1, we add an edge.
   *
   * Do not that in practice we only add those edges when we build a query graph for query planning
   * purposes, because not type-exploding is only an optimization but type-exploding will always "work"

/**
 * Performs a simple traversal of a query graph that _ignores_ edge conditions.
 *
 * Note that the order of the traversal shouldn't be relied on strongly, only that
 * the provided `onVertex` and `onEdges` will get called (exactly) once for every vertices
 * and edges in the query graph.
 *
 * That said, in practice, this method does `n` traversals, one from each root vertex in the
 * provided query graph (so in practice, `0 < n <= 3`) and each traversal happens to be a
 * depth first traversal (one that stops as soon as it encounters a vertex previously seen).
 *
 * @param graph - the query graph to traverse.
 * @param onVertex - a function called on each vertex traversed the first time it is traversed.
 * @param onEdges - a function called on each edges traversed the first time it is traversed.
 *   When this function is called for an edge, it is guaranteed that `onVertex` has previously
 *   been called on the edge's head vertex (there is no guarantee on the tail vertex in that
 *  `onVertex` may or may not have been called for it).
