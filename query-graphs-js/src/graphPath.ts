/**
 * An immutable path in a query graph.
 *
 * Path is mostly understood in the graph theoretical sense of the term, that is as "a connected series of edges"
 * and a `GraphPath` is generated by traversing a graph query.
 * However, as query graph edges may have conditions, a `GraphPath` also records, for reach edges it is composed of,
 * the set of paths (an `OpPathTree` in practice) that were taken to fulfill the edge conditions (when the edge has
 * one).
 *
 * Additionally, for each edge of the path, a `GraphPath` records the "trigger" that made the traversal take that
 * edge. In practice, the "trigger" can be seen as a way to decorate a path with some additional metadata for each
 * elements of the path. In practice, that trigger is used in 2 main ways (corresponding to our 2 main query graph
 * traversals):
 *  - for composition validation, the traversal of the federated query graph is driven by other transitions into the
 *    supergraph API query graphs (essentially, composition validation is about finding, for every supergraph API
 *    query graph path, a "matching" traversal of the federated query graph). In that case, for the graph paths
 *    we build on the federated query graph, the "trigger" will be one of the `Transition` from the supergraph
 *    API graph (which, granted, will be fairly similar to the one of the edge we're taking in the federated query
 *    graph; in practice, triggers are more useful in the query planning case).
 *  - for query planning, the traversal of the federated query graph is driven by the elements of the query we are
 *    planning. Which means that the "trigger" for taking an edge in this case will be an `OperationElement`
 *    (or null). See the specialized `OpGraphPath` that is defined for this use case.
 *
 * Lastly, some `GraphPath` can actually encode "null" edges: this is used during query planning in the (rare)
 * case where the query we plan for has fragment spread without type condition (or a "useless" one, on that doesn't
 * restrict the possible types anymore than they already were) but with some directives. In that case, we want
 * to preserve the information about the directive (to properly rebuild query plans later) but it doesn't correspond
 * to taking any edges, so we add a "null" edge and use the trigger to store the fragment spread.
 *
 * @param TTrigger - the type of the paths "triggers", metadata that can associated to each element of the path (see
 *   above for more details).
 * @param RV - the type of the vertex starting the path. This simply default to `Vertex` but is used in `RootPath`/`OpRootPath`
 *   to easily distinguish those paths that starts from a root of a query graph.
 * @param TNullEdge - typing information to indicate whether the path can have "null" edges or not. Either `null` (
 *   meaning that the path may have null edges) or `never` (the path cannot have null edges).
