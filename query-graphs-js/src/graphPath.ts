/**
 * An immutable path in a query graph.
 *
 * Path is mostly understood in the graph theoretical sense of the term, that is as "a connected series of edges"
 * and a `GraphPath` is generated by traversing a graph query.
 * However, as query graph edges may have conditions, a `GraphPath` also records, for reach edges it is composed of,
 * the set of paths (an `OpPathTree` in practice) that were taken to fulfill the edge conditions (when the edge has
 * one).
 *
 * Additionally, for each edge of the path, a `GraphPath` records the "trigger" that made the traversal take that
 * edge. In practice, the "trigger" can be seen as a way to decorate a path with some additional metadata for each
 * elements of the path. In practice, that trigger is used in 2 main ways (corresponding to our 2 main query graph
 * traversals):
 *  - for composition validation, the traversal of the federated query graph is driven by other transitions into the
 *    supergraph API query graphs (essentially, composition validation is about finding, for every supergraph API
 *    query graph path, a "matching" traversal of the federated query graph). In that case, for the graph paths
 *    we build on the federated query graph, the "trigger" will be one of the `Transition` from the supergraph
 *    API graph (which, granted, will be fairly similar to the one of the edge we're taking in the federated query
 *    graph; in practice, triggers are more useful in the query planning case).
 *  - for query planning, the traversal of the federated query graph is driven by the elements of the query we are
 *    planning. Which means that the "trigger" for taking an edge in this case will be an `OperationElement`
 *    (or null). See the specialized `OpGraphPath` that is defined for this use case.
 *
 * Lastly, some `GraphPath` can actually encode "null" edges: this is used during query planning in the (rare)
 * case where the query we plan for has fragment spread without type condition (or a "useless" one, on that doesn't
 * restrict the possible types anymore than they already were) but with some directives. In that case, we want
 * to preserve the information about the directive (to properly rebuild query plans later) but it doesn't correspond
 * to taking any edges, so we add a "null" edge and use the trigger to store the fragment spread.
 *
 * @param TTrigger - the type of the paths "triggers", metadata that can associated to each element of the path (see
 *   above for more details).
 * @param RV - the type of the vertex starting the path. This simply default to `Vertex` but is used in `RootPath`/`OpRootPath`
 *   to easily distinguish those paths that starts from a root of a query graph.
 * @param TNullEdge - typing information to indicate whether the path can have "null" edges or not. Either `null` (
 *   meaning that the path may have null edges) or `never` (the path cannot have null edges).

/*
 * This method is used to detect the case where using an interface field "directly" could fail (lead to a dead end later for the quer path)
 * _while_ type-exploding may succeed.
 *
 * In general, taking a field from an interface directly or through it's implementation by type-exploding leads to the same option, and so
 * taking one or the other is more of a matter of "which is more efficient". But there is a special case where this may not be the case,
 * and this is:
 *  1. when the interface is implemented by an entity type.
 *  2. the field being looked at is @shareable.
 *  3. the field type has a different set of fields (and less fields) in the "current" subgraph than in another one.
 *
 * Consider for instance:
 * ```
 *   # Subgraph A
 *   type Query {
 *     i: I
 *   }
  *
 *   interface I {
 *     s: S
 *   }
 *
 *   type T implements I @key(fields: "id") {
 *     id: ID!
 *     s: S @shareable
 *   }
 *
 *   type S @shareable {
 *     x: Int
 *   }
 * ```
 * ```
 *   # Subgraph B
 *   type T @key(fields: "id") {
 *     id: ID!
 *     s: S @shareable
 *   }
 *
 *   type S @shareable {
 *     x: Int
 *     y: Int
 *   }
 * ```
 * and suppose that `{ i { s { y } } }` is queried. If we follow `I.s` in subgraph A, then the `y` field
 * cannot be found, because `S` is not an entity (not that it could also be an entity but not have a usable
 * key between the 2 subgraphs) and so we cannot "jump" to subgraph B. However, if we "type-explode" into
 * implementation `T`, then we can jump to subgraph B from that, at which point we can reach `y`.
 *
 * So the goal of this method is to detect when we might be in such a case: when we are, we will have to
 * consider type-explosion on top of the direct route in case that direct route ends up "not panning out"
 * (note that by the time this method is called, we're only looking at the options for type `I.s`; we
 * do not know yet if `y` is queried next and so cannot tell if type-explosion will be necessary or not).
