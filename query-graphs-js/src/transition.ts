/**
 * The type of query graphs edge "transitions".
 *
 * An edge transition encodes what the edges correspond to, in the underlying graphQL
 * schema. Edges may correspond to:
 *  - a field (`FieldCollection`): the edge goes from (a vertex for) the field parent type, to the
 *    field (base) type.
 *  - a "downcast" (`DownCast`): the edges goes from an abstract type (interface or union) to a type
 *    that implements that abstract type (for interfaces) or is a member of that abstract type (for
 *    unions).
 *  - a key (`KeyResolution`), only found in "federated" query graphs: the edge goes from an
 *    entity type in a particular subgraph to the same entity type but in another subgraph. Edge
  *   with key transition _must_ have `conditions` corresponding to the key fields.
  * - a root type (`RootTypeResolution`), only found in "federated" query graphs: the edge goes from
  *   a root type (query, mutation or subscription) of a subgraph to the (same) root type of another
  *   subgraph. It encodes the fact that if a subgraph field returns a root type, any subgraph
  *   can be queried from there.
  * - a "subgraph entering" edge: this is a special case only used for the edges out of the root
  *   vertices of "federated" query graphs. It does not correspond to any physical graphQL elements
  *   but can be understood as the fact that the gateway is always free to start querying any of
  *   the subgraph services as needed.
