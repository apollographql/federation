## v0.1.3

- Updates to transitive dependencies.  No other substantial changes.

## v0.1.2

- Expose `printSubgraphSchema()` as a top-level export of the `@apollo/subgraph` package to maintain backwards compatibility with the `printSchema()` export from `@apollo/federation` [#1078](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1078)

## v0.1.0

This package is the subgraph-related slice of the `@apollo/federation` package which was previously responsible for both subgraph and composition bits. `@apollo/federation` users will experience no change in behavior for now, but our docs will suggest the usage of the `@apollo/subgraph` package going forward.
