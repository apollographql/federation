# CHANGELOG for `@apollo/subgraph`

## 2.4.5
### Patch Changes


- Supersedes v2.4.4 due to a publishing error with no dist/ folder ([#2583](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2583))

- Updated dependencies [[`c96e24c4`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/commit/c96e24c448bde3c4acfa5332335e868c701d7621)]:
  - @apollo/federation-internals@2.4.5

## 2.4.4
### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies []:
  - @apollo/federation-internals@2.4.4

## 2.4.3
### Patch Changes


- Resolve `Promise` references before calling `__resolveType` on interface ([#2556](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2556))
  
  Since the introduction of entity interfaces, users could not return
  a `Promise` from `__resolveReference` while implementing a synchronous,
  custom `__resolveType` function. This change fixes/permits this use case.
  
  Additional background / implementation details:
  
  Returning a `Promise` from `__resolveReference` has historically never
  been an issue. However, with the introduction of entity interfaces, the
  calling of an interface's `__resolveType` function became a new concern.
  
  `__resolveType` functions expect a reference (and shouldn't be concerned
  with whether those references are wrapped in a `Promise`). In order to
  address this, we can `await` the reference before calling the
  `__resolveType` (this handles both the non-`Promise` and `Promise` case).

This CHANGELOG pertains only to Apollo Federation packages in the 2.x range. The Federation v0.x equivalent for this package can be found [here](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/blob/version-0.x/subgraph-js/CHANGELOG.md) on the `version-0.x` branch of this repo.

## 2.3.0-beta.2
- `@tag` directive support for the `SCHEMA` location. This has been added to the 2.3 version of the federation spec, so to access this functionality you must bump your federation spec version to 2.3 by using `@link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.3", ...)` on your `schema` element. [PR #2314](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2314).

## 2.3.0

- Adds support for the 2.3 version of the federation spec (that is, `@link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.3")`), with:

## 2.2.0

- Adds support for the 2.2 version of the federation spec (that is, `@link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.2")`), which:
- allows `@shareable` to be repeatable so it can be allowed on both a type definition and its extensions [PR #2175](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2175).
- Drop support for node12 [PR #2202](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2202)

- Updates to transitive dependencies.  No other substantial changes.

This package is the subgraph-related slice of the `@apollo/federation` package which was previously responsible for both subgraph and composition bits. `@apollo/federation` users will experience no change in behavior for now, but our docs will suggest the usage of the `@apollo/subgraph` package going forward.
