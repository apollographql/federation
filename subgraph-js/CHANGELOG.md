# CHANGELOG for `@apollo/subgraph`

## vNEXT

- Make sure scalars don't print a `specifiedBy` directive unless specified in the subgraph. [PR #1463](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1463)

## v2.0.0-alpha.2

- __BREAKING__: Bump graphql peer dependency to `^15.7.0` [PR #1200](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1200)

## v2.0.0-alpha.1

- :tada: Initial alpha release of Federation 2.0.  For more information, see our [documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/d      ocs/federation/v2/).  We look forward to your feedback!
  > _Note!_ While packages like `@apollo/gateway` and `@apollo/query-planner` do have substantial changes in Federation 2, currently, there are no substantial changes to this package.  We anticipate that could change by the end of the v2 series.

## v0.1.3

- Updates to transitive dependencies.  No other substantial changes.

## v0.1.2

- Expose `printSubgraphSchema()` as a top-level export of the `@apollo/subgraph` package to maintain backwards compatibility with the `printSchema()` export from `@apollo/federation` [#1078](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1078)

## v0.1.1

- Correctly print `@tag` definitions and usages in subgraph SDL query [#1071](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1071)

## v0.1.0

- Initial release of new `@apollo/subgraph` package. This package is the subgraph-related slice of the `@apollo/federation` package which was previously responsible for both subgraph and composition bits. `@apollo/federation` users will experience no change in behavior for now, but our docs will suggest the usage of the `@apollo/subgraph` package going forward. For past iterations and CHANGELOG information of related work, see the [`@apollo/federation` CHANGELOG.md](../federation-js/CHANGELOG.md)[PR #1058](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1058)
