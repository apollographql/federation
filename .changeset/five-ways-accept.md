Adds the ability to compose and serialize directives for [Apollo Connectors](https://go.apollo.dev/connectors). To use Apollo Connectors, compose your supergraphs using [GraphOS](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/platform/schema-management) or [rover](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/commands/dev), and run your supergraph in [Apollo Router](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing) 2.0.0 or higher.
