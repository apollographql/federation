Adding new CompositionOption `maxValidationSubgraphPaths`. This value represents the maximum number of SubgraphPathInfo objects that may exist in a ValidationTraversal when checking for satisfiability. Setting this value can help composition error before running out of memory. Default is 1,000,000.
