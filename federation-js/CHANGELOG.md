# CHANGELOG for `@apollo/federation`

## vNEXT

> The changes noted within this `vNEXT` section have not been released yet.  New PRs and commits which introduce changes should include an entry in this `vNEXT` section as part of their development.  When a release is being prepared, a new header will be (manually) created below and the appropriate changes within that release will be moved into the new section.

- _Nothing yet. Stay tuned._

## v0.33.7

- Fix a bug in directive merging logic during composition [PR #1185](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1185)
- Update graphql rule imports to support graphql@16 users [PR #1202](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1202)

## v0.33.5

- Updates to transitive dependencies.  No other substantial changes.

## v0.33.4

- Updates to transitive dependencies.  No other substantial changes.

## v0.33.3

- Updates to transitive dependencies.  No other substantial changes.

## v0.33.2

- Updates to transitive dependencies.  No other substantial changes.

## v0.33.1

- Refine internal types to `FieldSet`s in places where we previously used `SelectionNode[]` [PR #1030](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1030)
- Emit a deprecation warning for deprecated functions. We would advise to adjust the code to use the new functionality, as the deprecated functions will be removed in a future version. If needed, deprecation warnings can be muted with either the --no-deprecation or --no-warnings command-line flags for node.js. Please keep in mind in doing so will also prevent any future deprecation warnings from node.js itself as well as from any package.[PR #1033](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1033).

## v0.33.0

- Add flexibility for @tag directive definition validation in subgraphs. @tag definitions are now permitted to be a subset of the spec's definition. This means that within the definition, `repeatable` is optional as are each of the directive locations. [PR #1022](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1022)

## v0.32.0

- __BREAKING__: This is a breaking change due to a `peerDependencies` update (`graphql@^15.4.0` -> `graphql@^15.5.3`). This `graphql` version includes a fix which resolves an issue which prevented the correct propagation of `@deprecated` usages on input type object fields into the printed subgraph schema. This can be considered a follow-up to [PR #996](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/996), which previously attempted to propagate @deprecated on *ALL* input values. [PR #1008](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1008)

## v0.31.0

- Remove composition responsibilities from supergraph printer. Fix schema sorting for sub- and super-graphs. [PR #1000](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1000)
- Update our subgraph and supergraph schema printers to match the printSchema function from graphql-js as closely as possible. Introduce printing capabilities for the @specifiedBy directive as well as @deprecated on input values. [PR #996](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/996)

## v0.30.0

- Introduce `@core/v0.2` support with [the `for:` directive](https://specs.apollo.dev/core/v0.2/#@core/for) argument which was introduced to the core specification in [specs-core#9](https://github.com/apollographql/specs-core/pull/9). For users of `printSupergraphSdl`, the output of that command will now be a `@core/v0.2` schema which is only compatible [with `@apollo/gateway0.39.0`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/blob/09ebb075/gateway-js/CHANGELOG.md#v0390) (or newer) versions.  The newly introduced `for:` argument allows a `@core` directive to specify its criticality to any consumer (including, and most importantly right now, the Gateway itself). The `for:` argument is optional - its absence means that the directive requires no additional support from the consumer. Its two available options - `EXECUTION` and `SECURITY` - both require explicit support from the consumer, else the consumer should fail to start / update to this unsupported schema.  For more information on supergraphs see [our documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/supergraphs/) or learn how to generate them in our [federation quickstart](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/quickstart/).  [PR #957](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/957)


## v0.29.0

- __DEPRECATION__: Rename `buildFederatedSchema` to `buildSubgraphSchema`. The previous name will continue to be supported but is deprecated. No functional change, usages of `buildFederatedSchema` should just be replaced with `buildSubgraphSchema`. [PR #915](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/915)
- __BREAKING__: Support @tag directive on Object, Interface, and Union types. This is a breaking change for current @tag users, as one of the validations was updated. Existing @tag definitions must now accomodate the additional locations `OBJECT | INTERFACE | UNION`. Usages of the @tag directive are rolled up indiscriminately during composition, just as they currently are with fields. For example, a @tag usage on an entity extension will end up in the supergraph alongside any other @tag usages on the same entity in other subgraphs. [PR #945](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/945) 

## v0.28.0

- When resolving the `Query._entities` field, honor `@cacheControl` directives on the object types that are members of the `_Entity` union. This feature is only enabled when your subgraph is running Apollo Server 3.0.2 or later. [PR #870](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/870) [Related docs PR](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/5536)

## v0.27.1

- Narrow `graphql` peer dependency to a more fitting range `^15.4.0` based on our current usage of the package. This requirement was introduced by, but not captured in, changes within the recently released `@apollo/federation@0.27.0`. As such, this change will be released as a `patch` since the breaking change already accidentally happened and this is a correction to that oversight. [PR #913](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/913)
## v0.27.0

- Skip missing types while iterating over field directive usages. It's possible to capture directive usages on fields whose types don't actually exist in the schema (due to invalid composition). See PR for more details. [PR #868](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/868)
- Disregard @inaccessible directive in subgraphs. This is a bit of a retrace on a previous decision. @inaccessible will now be achieved strictly through a combination of @tag and Studio usage. [PR #880](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/880)
- Require a @tag directive definition in subgraphs when there are @tag usages. [PR #882](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/882)

## v0.26.0

- Capture and propagate `@tag` and `@inaccessible` directives during composition from subgraph to supergraph SDL. This unblocks upcoming work for schema construction, schema filtering (API schemas), and future Studio features. [PR #756](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/756)

## v0.25.2

- Sort composed schema using graphql-js's `lexicographicSortSchema` for schema ordering determinism independent of serviceList ordering. [PR #824](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/824)

## v0.25.1

-  `ASTNodeWithDirectives` now includes all AST nodes with the `directives` field on it. [PR #755](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/755)

## Update spec

- Add `repeatable` keyword to the @key directive in federation spec. [PR #758](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/758)

## v0.25.0

- Composition errors now include `locations` corresponding to the line number & column in the subgraph SDL. [PR #686](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/686)

## v0.24.0

- Expand the range of supported `node` versions in the package's `engines` specifier to include the now-tested Node.js `16`. [PR #713](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/713)

## v0.23.2

- Remove lingering `core-js` polyfill imports, they're no longer needed (since `@apollo/gateway@0.15.0` dropped support for <= Node.js v10) and their presence is problematic since `core-js` isn't defined as a dependency within the package. Update `apollo-graphql` dependency which resolves a missing dependency (`sha.js`) within that package. [PR #699](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/699)

## v0.23.1

- This change is mostly a set of follow-up changes for PR #622. Most of these changes are internal (renaming, etc.). Some noteworthy changes worth mentioning are: a switch to graphql-js's `stripIgnoredCharacters` during field set printing, an update to the `join__Enum` generation algorithm, and some additional assertions. [PR #656](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/656)

## v0.23.0

- __BREAKING__ - Update CSDL to the new core schema format, implementing the currently-being-introduced core and join specs. `composeAndValidate` now returns `supergraphSdl` in the new format instead of `composedSdl` in the previous CSDL format. [PR #622](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/622)

## v0.22.0

- No changes to the package itself, though there are some small changes to the way this package is compiled and the tests within this package due to the changes in [PR #453](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/453)

## v0.21.2

- Fix an erroneous `break` to `continue`, follow-up fix for #478 [PR #481](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/481)

## v0.21.1

- Ignore thrown errors from `extendSchema` during composition (these particular errors are already validated against and returned as composition errors) [PR #478](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/478)

## v0.21.0

- __BREAKING__: Drop support for Node.js 8 and Node.js 10.  This package now only targets Node.js 12+ LTS (Long-Term Support) versions, the same as `@apollo/gateway`, which first received this treatment in https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4031.  Node.js 8 has already lapsed from the [Node.js Foundation's LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/release) and Node.js 10 (in _Maintenance LTS_ right now) is targeted to be end-of-life'd (EOL) at the end of April 2021.  [PR #311](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/311)
- Export `GraphQLSchemaModule` type. [PR #293](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/293)
- __BREAKING__: Remove `ComposedGraphQLSchema` type as it's no longer needed. This is breaking because it was part of the public API, though we strongly believe nobody was or should have had any need for this type. Update `composeAndValidate` function signature for better typing, and align the `compose` function signature with that of `composeAndValidate` [PR #278](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/278)
## v0.20.7

- Fix check for value types when having fields and arguments with the same name [PR #280](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/280)

## v0.20.6

- No changes, but please note that `v0.20.5` was a botched release, with no update to the `@apollo/query-planner-wasm` package that was needed. If you're seeing an error similar to `This data graph is missing a valid configuration. unreachable`, please upgrade to at least this patch release.

## v0.20.5

- Apply `repeatable` keyword to CSDL schema directives `@key` and `@graph. [PR #285](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-federation/pull/285)

## v0.20.4

- Only changes in the similarly versioned `@apollo/gateway` package.

## v0.20.3

- Fix warning for non-matching `@external` types when the declaration's type is non-null or a list [PR #4392](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4392)

## v0.20.2

- Only changes in the similarly versioned `@apollo/gateway` package.

## v0.20.1

- Only changes in the similarly versioned `@apollo/gateway` package.

## v0.20.0

- __FIX__: CSDL complex `@key`s shouldn't result in an unparseable document [PR #4490](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4490)
- __FIX__: Value type validations - restrict unions, scalars, enums [PR #4496](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4496)
- __FIX__: Composition - aggregate interfaces for types and interfaces in composed schema [PR #4497](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4497)
- __FIX__: Create new `@key` validations to prevent invalid compositions [PR #4498](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4498)
- CSDL: make `fields` directive args parseable [PR #4489](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4489)

## v0.19.1

- Include new directive definitions in CSDL [PR #4452](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4452)

## v0.19.0

- New federation composition format. Capture federation metadata in SDL [PR #4405](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4405)

## v0.18.1

- Only changes in the similarly versioned `@apollo/gateway` package.

## v0.18.0

- Only changes in the similarly versioned `@apollo/gateway` package.

## v0.17.0

- Only changes in the similarly versioned `@apollo/gateway` package.

## v0.16.11

- Reinstate typings for `make-fetch-happen` at the `apollo-gateway` project level (and now, additionally, `apollo-server-plugin-operation-registry`) [PR #4333](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4333)

## 0.16.10

- The default branch of the repository has been changed to `main`.  As this changed a number of references in the repository's `package.json` and `README.md` files (e.g., for badges, links, etc.), this necessitates a release to publish those changes to npm. [PR #4302](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4302)
- __BREAKING__: Move federation metadata from custom objects on schema nodes over to the `extensions` field on schema nodes which are intended for metadata. This is a breaking change because it narrows the `graphql` peer dependency from `^14.0.2` to `^14.5.0` which is when [`extensions` were introduced](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/2097) for all Type System objects. [PR #4302](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4313)

## 0.16.9

- Handle `@external` validation edge case for interface implementors [#4284](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4284)

## 0.16.7

- Only changes in the similarly versioned `@apollo/gateway` package.

## v0.16.6

- In-house `Maybe` type which was previously imported from `graphql` and has been moved in `v15.1.0`. [#4230](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4230)
- Remove remaining common primitives from SDL during composition. This is a follow up to [#4209](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4209), and additionally removes directives which are included in a schema by default (`@skip`, `@include`, `@deprecated`, and `@specifiedBy`) [#4228](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4209)

## v0.16.5

- Remove federation primitives from SDL during composition. This allows for services to report their *full* SDL from the `{ _service { sdl } }` query as opposed to the previously limited SDL without federation definitions. [#4209](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4209)

## v0.16.4

- Only changes in the similarly versioned `@apollo/gateway` package.

## v0.16.3

- Only changes in the similarly versioned `@apollo/gateway` package.

## v0.16.2

- Only changes in the similarly versioned `@apollo/gateway` package.

## v0.16.1

- Only changes in the similarly versioned `@apollo/gateway` package.

## v0.16.0

- No changes. This package was major versioned to maintain lockstep versioning with @apollo/gateway.

## v0.15.1

- Export `defaultRootOperationNameLookup` and `normalizeTypeDefs`; needed by `@apollo/gateway` to normalize root operation types when reporting to Apollo Graph Manager. [#4071](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4071)

## v0.15.0

## v0.13.2

- Only changes in the similarly versioned `@apollo/gateway` package.

## v0.12.1

- Fix `v0.12.0` regression: Preserve the `@deprecated` type-system directive as a special case when removing type system directives during composition, resolving an unintentional breaking change introduced by [#3736](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3736). [#3792](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3792)
