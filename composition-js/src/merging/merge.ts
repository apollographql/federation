          //  2. the type of an argument in the supergraph is a strict subtype the type that argument has in `subgraph` (the one
          //    with the `@provides`) _and_ the `@provides` selection relies on the type difference. Now, argument types are input
          //    types and the only subtyping difference input types is related to nullability (neither interfaces nor union are
          //    input types in particular), so the only case this can happen is if a field `x` has some argument `a` type `A` in
          //    `subgraph` but type `!A` with no default in the supergraph, _and_ the `@provides` queries that field `x` _without_
          //    value for `a` (valid when `a` has type `A` but not with `!A` and no default).

          // treatment for each.
