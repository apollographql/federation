title: Composition hints
---

When you successfully [compose](./federated-types/composition) the schemas provided by your [subgraphs](./subgraphs/) into a supergraph schema, the composition process might output **hints** that provide additional information about the result. Hints are primarily informative and _do not_ necessarily indicate that a problem needs to be fixed.

Hints are categorized under the following levels:

* \`WARN\`: Indicates a situation that might be expected but is usually temporary and should be double-checked. Typically, composition might have needed to ignore some elements from some subgraph when creating the supergraph.
* \`INFO\`: Suggests a potentially helpful improvement or highlights a noteworthy resolution made by composition. Can otherwise be ignored.
* \`DEBUG\`: Lower-level information that provides insight into the composition. These hints are of lesser importance/impact.

Note that hints are first and foremost informative and don't necessarily correspond to a problem to be fixed.

This document lists the hints that can be generated for each level, with a description of why each is generated.
