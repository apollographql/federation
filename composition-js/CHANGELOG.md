## vNEXT

> The changes noted within this `vNEXT` section have not been released yet.  New PRs and commits which introduce changes should include an entry in this `vNEXT` section as part of their development.  When a release is being prepared, a new header will be (manually) created below and the appropriate changes within that release will be moved into the new section.

- Fix merging of `@tag` directive when it is renamed in subgraphs [PR #1637](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1637).
- Generates supergraphs with `@link` instead of `@core`. As a result, prior federation 2 pre-release gateway will not read supergraphs generated by this version correctly, so you should upgrade the gateway to this version _before_ re-composing/deploying with this version.  [PR #1628](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1628).
