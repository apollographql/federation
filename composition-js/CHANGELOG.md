## v2.0.0-preview.11

- Add a level to hints, uppercase their code and related fixes [PR #1683](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1683).
- Add support for `@inaccessible` v0.2 [PR #1678](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1678)

## v2.0.0-preview.10

- Fix regression in composition validation introduced by #1653 [PR #1673](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1673).
- Add nodes when displaying hints for `@override` [PR #1684](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1684)

## v2.0.0-preview.9

- Fix handling of core/link when definitions are provided or partially so [PR #1662](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1662).
- Optimize composition validation when many entities spans many subgraphs [PR #1653](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1653).
- Support for Node 17 [PR #1541](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1541).
- Adds Support for `@tag/v0.2`, which allows the `@tag` directive to be additionally placed on arguments, scalars, enums, enum values, input objects, and input object fields. [PR #1652](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1652).
- Adds support for the `@override` directive on fields to indicate that a field should be moved from one subgraph to another. [PR #1484](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1484)

## v2.0.0-preview.8

NOTE: Be sure to upgrade the gateway _before_ re-composing/deploying with this version. See below and the changelog for `@apollo/gateway`.

- Adds support for `@inaccessible` in subgraphs [PR #1638](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1638).
- Fix merging of `@tag` directive when it is renamed in subgraphs [PR #1637](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1637).
- Generates supergraphs with `@link` instead of `@core`. As a result, prior federation 2 pre-release gateway will not read supergraphs generated by this version correctly, so you should upgrade the gateway to this version _before_ re-composing/deploying with this version.  [PR #1628](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1628).
